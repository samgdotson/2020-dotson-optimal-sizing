    "# Carbon Pricing Schemes and Nuclear Economics\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook derives a version of the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) that \n",
    "explicitly incorporates various carbon pricing schemes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deriving the LCOE\n",
    "\n",
    "LCOE is, by definition, the time averaged cost of electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, \n",
    "\n",
    "$e = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^N I_n-R_n+ O_n + F_n}{\\sum_{n=1}^N E_n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, for period, $n$\n",
    "- $e$ = levelized cost of electricity [\\$/MWh(e)]\n",
    "- $I_n =$ outstanding investments [\\$]\n",
    "- $R_n =$ revenue [\\$]\n",
    "- $O_n =$ operating costs [\\$]\n",
    "- $F_n =$ fuel costs [\\$]\n",
    "- $E_n =$ energy sold [MWh(e)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Revenue is simply \n",
    "\n",
    "$R_n = p_{e,n}E_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "- $p_{e,n} =$ price of electricity [$/MWh] \n",
    "\n",
    "In a deregulated market, the price of electricity is usually set by fossil fuels \n",
    "because nuclear power plants must run continuously, therefore acting as a \"price-taker.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy sold is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$E_n = P*\\eta*t$\n",
    "\n",
    "where\n",
    "- $P =$ nameplate capacity \n",
    "- $\\eta_n =$ average capacity factor \n",
    "- $t = $ the number of hours (typically a year, 8760)\n",
    "\n",
    "We also have to account for effective cost of money (inflation, loan interest rate, taxes, etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we define variable $x'$ that captures the effective cost of money. This modifies our LCOE\n",
    "formula to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$e = \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^N (1+x')^{-n}[I_n-R_n+ O_n + F_n]}{\\sum_{n=1}^N (1+x')^{-n}E_n}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we made an implicit assumption that $R_0 = O_0 = F_0 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A hypothetical nuclear power plant is\n",
    "    - $P = 1000$ [MWe]\n",
    "    - $\\eta$ = 0.92 (average nuclear capacity factor)\n",
    "    - $I_0 = 5.945$ [\\$/MWe]\n",
    "    - $O_n = 100,280$ [\\$/MWe-yr] (constant)\n",
    "    - $F_n = 2.3$ [\\$/MWh(e)] (constant)\n",
    "    - Plant lifetime is 40 years\n",
    "2. Thus there is a constant energy generation per year\n",
    "    - $E_n = P*\\eta*t = 1000*0.92*8760 = 8059200 MWh(e)$\n",
    "3. The effective cost of money is $3\\%$, keeping up with inflation.\n",
    "4. A competitive natural gas combined cycle plant is\n",
    "    - $P = 1000$ [MWe]\n",
    "    - $\\eta$ = 0.568 (average NGCC capacity factor)\n",
    "    - $I_0 = 0.978$ [\\$/MWe]\n",
    "    - $O_n = 11,000$ [\\$/MWe-yr] (constant)\n",
    "    - $F_n = 3.5$ [\\$/MWh(e)] (constant)\n",
    "    - Plant lifetime is 40 years\n",
