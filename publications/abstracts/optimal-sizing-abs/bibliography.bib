	abstract = {Molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) have a long history with the first design studies beginning in the 1950s at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ({ORNL}). Traditionally these reactors are thought of as thermal breeder reactors running on the thorium to 233U cycle and the historical competitor to fast breeder reactors. In the recent years, there has been a growing interest in molten salt reactors, which have been considered in the framework of the Generation {IV} International Forum, because of their several potentialities and favorable features when compared with conventional solid-fueled reactors. {MSRs} meet many of the future goals of nuclear energy, in particular for what concerns an improved sustainability, an inherent safety with strong negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, stable coolant, low pressure operation that don not require expensive containment, easy to control, passive decay heat cooling and unique characteristics in terms of actinide burning and waste reduction, while benefiting from the past experience acquired with the molten salt technology. As the only liquid-fueled reactor concept, the safety basis, characteristics and licensing of an {MSR} are different from solid-uranium fueled light water reactors. In this paper, a historical review of the major plant systems in {MSR} is presented. The features of different safety characteristics of {MSR} power plant are reviewed and assessment in comparison to other solid fueled light water reactors {LWRs}.},

	abstract = {As nuclear power expands, technical, economic, political, and environmental analyses of nuclear fuel cycles by simulators increase in importance. To date, however, current tools are often fleet-based rather than discrete and restrictively licensed rather than open source. Each of these choices presents a challenge to modeling fidelity, generality, efficiency, robustness, and scientific transparency. The Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem incorporate modern insights from simulation science and software architecture to solve these problems so that challenges in nuclear fuel cycle analysis can be better addressed. A summary of the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator framework and its modeling ecosystem are presented. Additionally, the implementation of each is discussed in the context of motivating challenges in nuclear fuel cycle simulation. Finally, the current capabilities of Cyclus are demonstrated for both open and closed fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {A new fuel cycle analysis code named {FAMOS} was developed for molten salt reactor ({MSR}) applications by extending the {DIF}3D code to model the transport of delayed neutron precursors and by coupling the extended {DIF}3D code with an in-house multi-channel thermal-hydraulics solver and an in-house nuclide depletion solver for the simulation of fuel depletion, reprocessing and feeding. {FAMOS} can also calculate the effective delayed neutron fraction accounting for the motion of fuel salt, the neutron generation time and the reactivity feedback coefficients. In order to verify the {FAMOS} code, the molten salt fast reactor ({MSFR}) proposed in the {EVOL} (Evaluation and Viability of Liquid Fuel Fast Reactor System) project was analyzed using {FAMOS} and the calculation results were compared with the reported results. The numerical results indicate that {FAMOS} is capable of simulating the fuel cycle process of {MSRs} with good accuracy. {FAMOS} was applied to the fuel cycle analysis of the molten salt breeder reactor ({MSBR}) as well. The effects of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the neutronics characteristics and fuel cycle performances of {MSBR} were evaluated using three different calculation models. The drift of delayed neutron precursors and the temperature distribution shift the axial power distribution upward and downward, respectively, and the latter effect is stronger than the former one. However, the impacts of the temperature distribution and the drift of delayed neutron precursors on the depletion and buildup behaviors of actinides and fission products in {MSRs} are negligible. It is also possible to achieve a 233U conversion ratio larger than 1.0 without protactinium removal and thus to operate the {MSBR} by only feeding 232Th, except for the initial start-up stage.},

The fuel of such reactors being liquid, it can be easily reprocessed to overcome neutronic limits. In the late sixties, the {MSBR} project showed that breeding is possible with thorium in a thermal spectrum, provided that an efficient pyrochemical reprocessing is added. With tools developed around the Monte Carlo {MCNP} code, we first re-evaluate the performance of a {MSBR}-like reference system with 232Th/233U fuel. We find an important reduction of inventories and induced radiotoxicities at equilibrium compared to other fuel cycles, with a doubling time of about thirty years. We then study how to start this interesting reference system with theplutonium from {PWR} spent fuel. Such a transition appears slow and difficult, since it is very sensitive to the fissile quality of the plutonium used. Deployment scenarios of 232Th/233U {MSBR}-like systems from the existing French {PWRs} demonstrate the advantage of an upstream 233U production in other reactors, allowing a direct start of the {MSBR}-like systems with 233U. This finally leads us to explore alternatives to some {MSBR} features, for energy production with 232Th/233U fuel from the start. We thus test different options, especially in terms of core neutronics optimization and reprocessing unit adaptation.},

The safety analysis demonstrates an excellent reactor behavior with respect to the majority of single and combined unprotected events. The work also reveals the necessity to get more accurate nuclear data for the chlorine isotopes and to investigate the reactor configuration with radial fertile blanket.

A wire-wrapped fuel bundle is a complex configuration for which little data is available for verification and validation of new simulation tools.

{UGent} and {NRG} performed their simulations with commercially available computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) codes. The high-fidelity Argonne large-eddy simulations were performed with Nek5000, used for {CFD} in the Simulation-based High-efficiency Advanced Reactor Prototyping ({SHARP}) suite. {SHARP} is a versatile tool that is being developed to model the core of a wide variety of reactor types under various scenarios. It is intended both to serve as a surrogate for physical experiments and to provide insight into experimental results.

Comparison of the results obtained by the different participants with the reference Nek5000 results shows good agreement, especially for the cross-flow data. The comparison also helps highlight issues with current modeling approaches.

The results of the study will be valuable in the design and licensing process of {MYRRHA}, a flexible fast research reactor under design at {SCK}·{CEN} that features wire-wrapped fuel bundles cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic.},

This study also simulated, in detail, an oxide reduction group process embracing electrolytic reduction, cathode processing, and salt purification.

	abstract = {A high-temperature steam electrolysis ({HTSE}) plant is proposed as a flexible load resource to be integrated with a light water reactor ({LWR}) in nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems (N-R {HESs}). This integrated energy system is capable of dynamically apportioning electrical and thermal energy on an industrial scale to meet both grid demand and energy needs in the {HTSE} plant without generating greenhouse gases. A dynamic performance analysis of such a system is carried out to evaluate its technical feasibility and benefits, and safety operating under highly variable conditions requiring flexible output. To support the dynamic analysis, special emphasis is given here to the modeling and control design of the {HTSE} process, which employs planar solid oxide electrolysis cells, coupled to an {LWR}. The proposed model includes practical constraints, such as operating limits of equipment, and allows the simulation of transient response of the {LWR}/{HTSE} integration case with high penetration of renewable resources. Simulation results involving several case studies show that the {HTSE} integrated N-R {HESs} could lead to efficient utilization of clean energy generation sources at levels that maximize profits, i.e., steady-state operation of a nuclear reactor and high penetration of solar or wind energy without curtailment, by providing dispatchable electricity to the grid and producing alternative value-added products (hydrogen and oxygen). The results also indicate that the system can provide various types of ancillary services (i.e., regulation, operating reserves, and load following) to support grid stability while satisfying its operating constraints and control objectives; thus, it is capable of effectively and economically mitigating the increasing levels of dynamic variability and uncertainty introduced by renewables.},

Low-resolution gamma-ray spectra that contain mixtures of radioisotopes often exhibit feature overlap, requiring algorithms that can analyze these features when overlap occurs. While machine learning and pattern recognition algorithms have shown promise for the problem of radioisotope identification, their ability to identify and quantify mixtures of radioisotopes has not been studied. Because machine-learning algorithms use abstract features of the spectrum, such as the shape of overlapping peaks and Compton continuum, they are a natural choice for analyzing radioisotope mixtures. An artificial neural network ({ANN}) has been trained to calculate the relative activities of 32 radioisotopes in a spectrum. The {ANN} is trained with simulated gamma-ray spectra, allowing easy expansion of the library of target radioisotopes. In this paper, we present our initial algorithms based on an {ANN} and evaluate them against a series of measured and simulated spectra.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) represent a class of reactors that use liquid salt, usually fluoride based or chloride based, as either a coolant with a solid fuel (such as fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactors) or as a combined coolant and fuel with the fuel dissolved in a carrier salt. For liquid-fueled {MSRs}, the salt can be processed online or in a batch mode to allow for removal of fission products as well as for introduction of fissile fuel and fertile materials during reactor operation. The {MSR} is most commonly associated with the 233U/thorium fuel cycle, as the nuclear properties of 233U combined with the online removal of parasitic absorbers enable the design of a thermal-spectrum breeder reactor. However, {MSR} concepts have been developed using all neutron energy spectra (thermal, intermediate, fast, and mixed-spectrum zoned concepts) and with a variety of fuels including uranium, thorium, plutonium, and minor actinides. Early {MSR} work was supported by a significant research and development (R\&D) program that resulted in two experimental systems operating at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1950s and 1960s: the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Subsequent design studies in the 1970s focusing on thermal-spectrum thorium-fueled systems established reference concepts for two major design variants: (1) a molten salt breeder reactor ({MSBR}) with multiple configurations that could breed additional fissile material or maintain self-sustaining operation and (2) a denatured molten salt reactor ({DMSR}) with enhanced proliferation resistance. {MSRs} have been selected as one of the Generation {IV} systems, and development activity has been seen in fast-spectrum {MSRs}, waste-burning {MSRs}, and {MSRs} fueled with low-enriched uranium as well as in more traditional thorium fuel cycle–based {MSRs}. This paper provides a historical background of {MSR} R\&D efforts, surveys and summarizes many of the recent developments, and provides analysis comparing thorium-based {MSRs} by way of example.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}) were conceived at the early stages of nuclear energy in view of the favourable features fostered by a liquid fuel. They were developed as graphite-moderated thorium-fuelled breeder reactors till the seventies, when studies on this reactor concept were mostly abandoned in favour of the liquid–metal fast breeder concepts. A decade ago, the {MSRs} were included among the six {GEN}-{IV} systems and a core optimization process allowing for the {GEN}-{IV} main objectives led toward a fast-spectrum {MSR} concept ({MSFR} – Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Albeit advantageous in terms of U-233 breeding and/or radio-active waste burning, the new concept lacks the notable know-how available for the thermal-spectrum {MSR} technology. The present paper preliminarily investigates the {MSR} dynamics, based on the conceptual {MSFR} design currently available. A primary objective is to benchmark two different models of the {MSFR} primary circuit, both of them including a detailed and fully-coupled (node-wise) representation of turbulent fuel-salt flow, neutron diffusion, and delayed-neutron precursor diffusion and convection. A good agreement is generally observed between the adopted models, though some discrepancies exist in the temperature-field, with ensuing mild impacts on the reactor dynamics. The performed analyses are also used for a preliminary characterization of the {MSFR} steady-state and accidental transient response. Some points of enhancement needed in the {MSFR} conceptual design are identified, mainly related to in-core velocity and temperature fields. The reactor response following major accidental transient initiators suggests a generally benign behaviour of this reactor concept.},

It is able to represent a wide range of Sodium cooled Fast Reactor designs using oxide fuels and a wide range of fuel management strategies within fuel cycle simulation tools. A comprehensive analysis of simplification options has been made in order to choose the right level of complexity for the reference full core depletion calculations performed with the {MURE} code used for the training of the meta-model. The process from these reference calculations to the final meta-model is explained and a specific focus is given to the operations going from detailed full core depletion results to global results suitable for neural networks training. Details on the creation process for neural networks based predictors, one for each average cross-section, and their training on full core depletion calculations are given as well as the implementation within the {CLASS} code. The irradiation meta-model achieves good precision on all major and minor actinides present in spent fuel. The designs and loaded fuel covered by the model allow significant burner to strong breeder strategies. A sensitivity analysis shows that the number of fertile blankets is the primary contributor for breeding capabilities, but effects of isotopic composition are also significant. A test scenario illustrates the model capacity to simulate burner and breeder designs.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor ({MSR}) concepts are being actively developed by several private companies, with some touting the fuel cycle benefits of this technology. Simulating the deployment of {MSRs} and their effect on fuel cycle transitions is the role of a system dynamics fuel cycles tool. However, many current fuel cycles tools have difficulty modeling {MSR} isotopic variations because they were designed for modeling existing reactors based on discrete fuel elements with batch fueling schemes (i.e., charge and discharge). This work presents {ORION} fuel cycle modeling results using a specific high power density fast spectrum {MSR} design. For code verification, a single-stage {MSR} fuel cycle was set up in {ORION} and results were compared with the results from the {SCALE}-based reactor physics model ({ChemTriton}). A transition scenario was set up in {ORION} from the current light water reactor fleet to a future fleet of {MSRs} to study the characteristics of an {MSR} that affect its performance during transition. Several transition scenarios were set with holds and delays in place that are representative of a sodium fast reactor as modeled in Evaluation Group 23 for the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign Evaluation and Screening Study. Several {MSR} characteristics lend to its high performance and ease in transition from the current fuel cycle: fissile material is only loaded at initial startup; all fissile material is available as it is bred due to online fuel processing; and fissile material recirculating through the core is briefly held in tanks for processing and has very minimal out-of-core time (on the order of a minutes to a few days). These characteristics are in contrast to a solid-fueled reactor, which requires discharge, cooling, and fabrication of fuel all of which could take a few months to a few years and repeated loading of fresh fuel assemblies. A solid-fueled reactor only discharges a fraction of a core every year.},

	abstract = {Nuclear hybrid energy systems ({NHESs}) have been proposed as an effective element to incorporate high penetration of clean energy (e.g., nuclear and renewable). This paper focuses on the operations optimization of two specific {NHES} configurations to address the variability raised from wholesale electricity markets and renewable generation. Both analytical and numerical approaches are used to obtain the optimal operations schedule. Key economic figures of merit are evaluated under optimized and constant (i.e., time-invariant) operations to demonstrate the benefit of the optimization, which also suggests the economic viability of the considered {NHESs} under the proposed operations optimizer. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis on commodity prices is conducted for better understanding of the considered {NHESs}.},

Reaching temperatures above 700 °C with stable flow rates around 5 cm/s, the loop exhibits a range of flow phenomena pertinent to high temperature natural circulation safety systems for nuclear reactors. This paper discusses the system and several operating conditions spanning a wide range of behavior to aid the development of other systems, simulation benchmarks, or system-codes. Analysis of heat transport phenomena indicates that standard Nusselt number correlations apply to a first approximation. More accurate salt-freezing models may be necessary for air-cooled salt-systems due to the insulating affect of the low thermal-conductivity frozen salt layer on the cold pipe walls.},

Among the design peculiarities, this circulating fuel reactor features a helium bubbling system aimed at removing on-line gaseous fission products, and metallic particles as well. From a modelling point of view, the presence of helium bubbles in the core needs to be assessed both from a neutronics and thermal-hydraulics point of view. In this paper, the attention is paid to the first aspect, analysing the void reactivity effect induced by the bubbles by means of a Monte Carlo, an {SP}3 neutron transport and a neutron diffusion approach. Since the distribution of helium bubbles is not uniform in the core but strongly depends on the fuel salt flow conditions, as well as on the location of their injection and extraction, a coupling scheme between Serpent 2 and {OpenFOAM} codes is adopted for the Monte Carlo analysis. In this way, the Monte Carlo code Serpent 2 is provided with a real bubble distribution calculated by means of a two-phase Euler-Euler solver implemented in {OpenFOAM}. The outcome puts in evidence the difference arising when a uniform and a real distribution of bubbles is considered in a Monte Carlo calculation. These results are also compared with an {SP}3 neutron transport and a neutron diffusion solver implemented in {OpenFOAM}, highlighting the difference among the three neutronics approaches herein adopted.},

Despite the sophistication of today’s Monte Carlo codes for representing realistic geometry and physics interactions, correct results can be obtained in criticality problems only if users pay attention to source convergence in the Monte Carlo iterations and to running a sufficient number of neutron histories to adequately sample all significant regions of the problem. Recommended best practices for criticality calculations are reviewed and applied to several practical problems for nuclear reactors and criticality safety, including the “K-effective of the World” problem. Numerical results illustrate the concerns about convergence and bias. The general conclusion of is that with today’s high-performance computers, improved understanding of the theory, new tools for diagnosing convergence (e.g., Shannon entropy of the fission distribution), and clear practical guidance for performing calculations, practitioners will have a greater degree of confidence than ever of obtaining correct results for Monte Carlo criticality calculations.},

	abstract = {Engineering demonstration reactors are nuclear reactors built to establish proof of concept for technology options that have never been built. Examples of engineering demonstration reactors include Peach Bottom 1 for high temperature gas-cooled reactors and the Experimental Breeder Reactor-{II} for sodium-cooled fast reactors. Engineering demonstrations have historically played a vital role in advancing the technology readiness level of reactor concepts. This paper details a preconceptual design for a fluoride salt-cooled engineering demonstration reactor. The fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor ({FHR}) demonstration reactor ({DR}) is a concept for a salt-cooled reactor with 100 megawatts of thermal output. It would use tristructural-isotropic ({TRISO}) particle fuel in compacts within prismatic graphite blocks. {FLiBe} (2 7LiF-{BeF}2) is the reference primary coolant. The {FHR} {DR} is designed to be small, simple, and affordable. Development of the {FHR} {DR} is an intermediate step to enable near-term commercial {FHRs}. The design philosophy of the {FHR} {DR} was focused on safety, near-term deployment, and flexibility. Lower risk technologies are purposely included in the initial {FHR} {DR} design to ensure that the reactor can be built, licensed, and operated as an engineering demonstration with minimal risk and cost. These technologies include {TRISO} particle fuel, replaceable core structures, and consistent structural material selection for core structures and the primary and intermediate loops, and tube-and-shell primary-to-intermediate heat exchangers.

Important capabilities to be demonstrated by building and operating the {FHR} {DR} include:•
core design methodologies,
•
heat exchanger performance (including passive decay heat removal),
•
pump performance,
•
reactivity control,
•
salt chemistry control to maximize plant life,
•
salt procurement, handling, maintenance and ultimate disposal, and
•
tritium management.
Non-nuclear separate and integral test efforts (e.g., heated salt loops or loops using simulant fluids) are necessary to develop the technologies that will be demonstrated in the {FHR} {DR}.},

	abstract = {During the molten salt electrorefining of spent nuclear fuel, multiple phases such as oxide, solid metal, liquid metal, and molten salt often co-exist. Computational modeling can be a useful tool for understanding the reaction mechanism across the multiple phases. The new model has been developed and applied to a lab-scale electrorefining with liquid metal anode and solid cathode. The benchmark study predicts anodic dissolution and cathodic deposition of U and Pu with minor disagreements. In particular, the on-set of Pu deposition on the surface of the solid cathode is well estimated, which is important for the quality of U ingot and the safeguards of process. The underestimation of U deposition (∼6\%) and Pu dissolution (∼25\%) at the end of simulation is explained by unconsidered reaction species such as Np and Am from the liquid Cd anode, which overestimates the dissolution of Pu from the anode compared to the measured data. The sensitivity study also reveals the transition behaviors of electrochemical reactions for U and Pu on the solid cathode are changed by diffusion boundary layer thickness, transfer coefficients, and the difference of electrochemical potentials more sensitively than those of the liquid metal anode. For this specific experiment case, the thinner diffusion boundary layer improves the prediction of cathodic reactions particularly at the end of electrorefining.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates how concentrations of certain fission products and their related gamma-ray emissions can be used to discriminate between uranium oxide ({UOX}) and mixed oxide ({MOX}) type fuel. Discrimination of irradiated {MOX} fuel from irradiated {UOX} fuel is important in nuclear facilities and for transport of nuclear fuel, for purposes of both criticality safety and nuclear safeguards. Although facility operators keep records on the identity and properties of each fuel, tools for nuclear safeguards inspectors that enable independent verification of the fuel are critical in the recovery of continuity of knowledge, should it be lost.
A discrimination methodology for classification of {UOX} and {MOX} fuel, based on passive gamma-ray spectroscopy data and multivariate analysis methods, is presented. Nuclear fuels and their gamma-ray emissions were simulated in the Monte Carlo code Serpent, and the resulting data was used as input to train seven different multivariate classification techniques. The trained classifiers were subsequently implemented and evaluated with respect to their capabilities to correctly predict the classes of unknown fuel items.
The best results concerning successful discrimination of {UOX} and {MOX}-fuel were acquired when using non-linear classification techniques, such as the k nearest neighbors method and the Gaussian kernel support vector machine. For fuel with cooling times up to 20 years, when it is considered that gamma-rays from the isotope  134Cs can still be efficiently measured, success rates of 100\% were obtained. A sensitivity analysis indicated that these methods were also robust.},

High-temperature heat pipes are used in this new design to improve the system inherent safety and make the {PRHRS} more compact. An experimental system using fluoride salt {FLiNaK} has been constructed to validate and support the future design of {PRHRS} of molten salt reactors. In this research, tests on the natural convection heat transfer of {FLiNaK} in the drain tank with an inclined heat pipe inserted at different heights were performed. The temperature distribution of fluoride salt in the tank was analyzed. The height of heat pipe and the bulk temperature of {FLiNaK} have little influence on the normalized salt temperature distribution. However, with the height of heat pipe increasing, the temperature difference of molten salt decreases and heat transfer coefficient of natural convection increases. In addition, the empirical correlations of natural convection heat transfer between liquid {FLiNaK} and inclined heat pipe are obtained within the range of Rayleigh numbers from 3.97 × 106 to 1.16 × 107. The comparisons show that a good agreement with less than 5\% deviation is obtained between the proposed correlations and the test data.},

	abstract = {A molten salt reactor ({MSR}) is characterized by simultaneously using liquid fuel salt as both the nuclear fuel and coolant. The redistribution of delayed neutron precursors ({DNPs}) makes the transient behavior of {MSRs} different from traditional solid-fuel reactors. In this study, a 3D coupled neutronics/thermal hydraulics code, {MOREL}2.0, was employed to analyze a liquid-fuel Thorium Molten Salt Reactor ({TMSR}-{LF}) under perturbations of fuel pump start-up and coast-down and by overheating and overcooling the inlet fuel temperature. Some transient processes were simulated to provide guidance for the future design and optimization of {TMSR}-{LFs}. In response to the perturbations, reactivity was lost and gained in the pump start-up and coast-down, respectively. Overheating the inlet fuel temperature introduced negative reactivity, and {TMSR}-{LF} maintained a safety state, while overcooling the inlet fuel temperature resulted in positive reactivity. Overcooling by 70 K produced a supercritical transient condition and a rapid increase in power within a short period, which was followed by a decrease in power due to negative temperature feedback. The transient results demonstrate that the negative temperature feedback coefficients guarantee {TMSR}-{LF} inherent safety and the variation range of temperature stay within the safety margin.},

This model is mainly composed of the dynamics of the reactor, steam generator, turbine, deaerator, heat exchangers and secondary steam flow network. Then, the steady and transient validation of this lumped-parameter model are given based on the comparison between the parameter values given by this model and the model for plant design, which shows that both the steady and transient errors are acceptable, and which further reveals that the thermal resistances and capacities of this model are properly given. Finally, the open-loop responses under different exterior disturbances such as reactivity and coolant flowrates as well as the closed-loop responses under the cases of power ramp and switch are all given by the numerical simulation software developed based upon this newly-built lumped-parameter model for {NHR}200-{II} plant, where the rationality of the responses are analyzed from the viewpoint of plant physics and thermal-hydraulics. This model can be utilized for not only the control system design but also the development of a real-time simulator for the hardware-in-loop verification of control systems.},

	url = {http://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/handle/11375/19141},
	abstract = {In the process of exploring the thorium fuel application in {CANDU} reactors, it is important to consider the proliferation resistance level as a parameter for comparison with current natural uranium fuel. The concept of a whole fuel cycle was introduced to show the variations in the proliferation resistance level as the material is flowing through the cycle. 

The depletion and decay histories were simulated with {SCALE} 6.1 code and the results such as isotopes composition, decay heat, and radioactivity were used to analyze the material attractiveness of pure heavy metal for weapon production. They also served as the intrinsic features during the proliferation resistance level calculation. 

The Multi-Attribute Utility Analysis ({MAUA}) method developed by Chalton was used to compare different {CANDU} fuel cycles with quantified values ({PR}) from the viewpoint of proliferation resistance. To improve the biased {MAUA} results that gave a {PR} of 0.76 to {CANDU} while 0.93 to {PWR}, the attributes of size/weight and refueling scheme were reconsidered. In addition, the sensitive technology involved was added for the proliferation resistance recalculation. 

The results showed an increased {PR} value of 0.82 for natural uranium {CANDU} reactor as well as a decreasing trend of {PR} at the back end. {PWR} has a {PR} of 0.82 with revised {MAUA} method. The {PR} comparison of thorium and natural uranium fuel indicated that Th/Pu fuel has a slightly higher {PR} value in the reactor. The Figure of Merit ({FOM}) method developed by Bathke was used to validate the {PR} results from another perspective: the attractiveness of pure heavy metals that are suitable for nuclear weapon production. 

The results showed that {FOM} of plutonium keeps increasing with decay time and the trend becomes more significant after disposal in the deep geological repository. The {FOM} of uranium from Th/Pu cases is higher than that of Pu within several hundred years but maintains a decreasing trend. The decreasing {FOM} of uranium is preferred for direct disposal in deep geological repository. 

The decreased {PR} level and the increased {FOM} value of plutonium at the back end of a fuel cycle indicate the importance of implementing the security and safeguard for each facility dealing with nuclear materials. The comparison results of {PR} and {FOM} values for different fuel provided feedback and suggestions for the new fuel application.},

Both transient and steady state solutions are available and compressibility no longer dictates the time step limits. Difficulties of compressible flow with uniform interpolation which exist due to local incompressibility in low velocity regions are avoided. The transition to the fully explicit form at high Mach number flows can be accomplished automatically yielding a form slightly different from that of conventional procedures. The algorithm is available for shallow water equations where its advantages promise to be large. Several examples illustrate the paper.},

When the boundary—or, more commonly, a portion of it—is not endowed with a Dirichlet {BC}, we are faced with selecting what are called open boundary conditions ({OBCs}), because the fluid may presumably enter or leave the domain through such boundaries. The two minisymposia on {OBCs} that are summarized in this paper had the objective of finding the best {OBCs} for a small subset of two-dimensional test problems. This objective, which of course is not really well-defined, was not met (we believe), but the contributions obtained probably raised many more questions/issues than were resolved—notable among them being the advent of a new class of {OBCs} that we call {FBCs} (fuzzy boundary conditions).},

	abstract = {The pressure is a somewhat mysterious quantity in incompressible flows. It is not a thermodynamic variable as there is no ‘equation of state’ for an incompressible fluid. It is in one sense a mathematical artefact—a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the velocity field to remain divergence-free; i.e., incompressible—yet its gradient is a relevant physical quantity: a force per unit volume. It propagates at infinite speed in order to keep the flow always and everywhere incompressible; i.e., it is always in equilibrium with a time-varying divergence-free velocity field. It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well-defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. Herein we show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary.},

The results of the {CFD} simulations show that for the chosen core design acceptable temperature distributions can be obtained by using a curved core cavity shape, inlets and outlets. The hot spot temperature is less than 10 °C above the average core outlet temperature and is located in the centre of the top wall of the core. The results show also a moderate level of sensitivity to the working point.},

	abstract = {The paper presents a new model of turbulence in which the local turbulent viscosity is determined from the solution of transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy and the energy dissipation rate. The major component of this work has been the provision of a suitable form of the model for regions where the turbulence Reynolds number is low. The model has been applied to the prediction of wall boundary-layer flows in which streamwise accelerations are so severe that the boundary layer reverts partially towards laminar. In all cases, the predicted hydrodynamic and heat-transfer development of the boundary layers is in close agreement with the measured behaviour. L'article présente un nouveau modèle de turbulence dans lequel la viscosité turbulente locale est déterminée à partir de la solution des équations de transport pour l'énergie cinétique de turbulence et la vitesse de dissipation d'énergie. La majeure partie de ce travail a été l'élaboration d'une forme adéquate du modèle pour des régions où le nombre de Reynolds de turbulence est faible. Le modèle a été appliqué à la prédiction des écoulements à couche limite à la paroi dans lesquels des accélérations longitudinales sont si fortes que la couche limite redevient partiellement laminaire. Dans tous les cas, le développement hydrodynamique et thermique prévu des couches limites est en parfait accord avec le comportement observé. Die Arbeit behandelt ein neuse Turbulenzmodell, bei dem die örtliche turbulente Zähigkeit aus der Lösung der Transportgleichungen für die kinetische Energie der Turbulenz und der Energiedissipation bestimmt wird. Der Hauptteil dieser Arbeit bestand darin, eine passende Form des Modells für Bereiche zu schaffen, in denen die Reynoldszahl der Turbulenz niedrig ist. Das Modell ist auf die Bestimmung von Wandgrenzschichtströmungen angewandt worden, bein denen so starke Beschleunigungen in Strömungsrichtung auftreten, dass die Grenzschicht teilweise in den laminaren Bereicht umschlägt. In allen Fällen ist die berechnete Entwicklung der hydrodynamischen und thermischen Grenzschicht in guter Übereinstimmung mit dem gemessenen Verhalten.},

An algorithm for decomposing large tally data in Monte Carlo particle transport simulations is developed, analyzed, and implemented in a continuous-energy Monte Carlo code, {OpenMC}. The algorithm is based on a non-overlapping decomposition of compute nodes into tracking processors and tally servers. The former are used to simulate the movement of particles through the domain while the latter continuously receive and update tally data. A performance model for this approach is developed, suggesting that, for a range of parameters relevant to {LWR} analysis, the tally server algorithm should perform with minimal overhead on contemporary supercomputers. An implementation of the algorithm in {OpenMC} is then tested on the Intrepid and Titan supercomputers, supporting the key predictions of the model over a wide range of parameters. We thus conclude that the tally server algorithm is a successful approach to circumventing classical on-node memory constraints en route to unprecedentedly detailed Monte Carlo reactor simulations.},

and other high-level waste in deep borehole repositories. The canister is suitable for disposal
of various waste forms, such as fuel assemblies and vitrified waste. The design addresses real
and perceived hazards of transporting and placing high-level waste, in the form of spent reactor
fuel, into a deep igneous rock environment. The thermal performance of the design is
emphasized.
To provide an option for second generation repositories at a competitive cost, the
canister reference design is based on standard oil drilling technology. Calculations are
conducted to assess stresses in the waste string and granite, temperatures and thermal gradients,
sensitivity of thermal calculations to variables, and cost. Recommendations are made for
future work.},

geological, hydrogeochemical, and geophysical characteristics that are related to the suitability of the site
for deep drilling and borehole construction, waste emplacement activities, waste isolation (seals and
surrounding geology), and long-term safety of the deep borehole disposal system. Logistical factors to be
considered include: local or regional availability of drilling contractors (equipment, services, and
materials) capable of drilling a large-diameter hole to approximately 5,000 m depth; construction of
surface facilities and waste handling and emplacement equipment; legal and regulatory requirements
associated with drilling, operation, and post-closure; and access to transportation systems. Social and
political considerations include the distance from population centers and the support or opposition of local
and state entities and other stakeholders to the facility and its operations. These technical, logistical, and
sociopolitical factors are examined in the context of a consent-based siting process for a deep disposal
borehole, which would be the first phase in developing an operating facility.},

Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the {JFNK} method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. {JFNK} has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place {JFNK} in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems ({BVPs}) and initial value problems ({IVPs}). We provide an overview of the mechanics of {JFNK} and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that {JFNK} can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of {JFNK}, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how {JFNK} may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

	abstract = {Conventional coupling paradigms currently used to couple different physics components in reactor analysis problems can be inconsistent in their treatment of the nonlinear terms due to the operator-split ({OS}) strategies employed. This leads to the usage of small time steps to maintain accuracy requirements, thereby increasing the overall computational time. This paper proposes some remedies to {OS} techniques that can restore consistency in the coupling of the nonlinear terms and explores high-order mono-block nonlinearly consistent techniques with time step control. The performance of the methods was studied for several transient scenarios using a 0D point-kinetics/thermal-hydraulics lumped model and a 1D neutronics/heat conduction/enthalpy balance model. The results prove that consistent approximations can be made to enhance the overall accuracy in conventional codes with simple nonintrusive techniques. Additionally, an analysis of a mono-block coupling strategy (without having recourse to an {OS} strategy) is carried out to assess automated time stepping control using higher order Implicit Runge–Kutta ({IRK}) schemes. The conclusions from these results indicate that nonlinearly consistent adaptive time stepping methods can provide better accuracy and reliability in the solution fields than constant time stepping methods, even for transients with rapid and discontinuous variations.},

	abstract = {This introduction to heat transfer offers advanced undergraduate and graduate engineering students a solid foundation in the subjects of conduction, convection, radiation, and phase-change, in addition to the related topic of mass transfer. A staple of engineering courses around the world for more than three decades, it has been revised and updated regularly by the authors, a pair of recognized experts in the field. The text addresses the implications, limitations, and meanings of many aspects of heat transfer, connecting the subject to its real-world applications and developing students' insight into related phenomena.  Three introductory chapters form a minicourse in heat transfer, covering all of the subjects discussed in detail in subsequent chapters. This unique and effective feature introduces heat exchangers early in the development, rather than at the end. The authors also present a novel and simplified method for dimensional analysis, and they capitalize on the similarity of natural convection and film condensation to develop these two topics in a parallel manner. Worked examples and end-of-chapter exercises appear throughout the book, along with well-drawn, illuminating figures.},

	abstract = {In this work, an analytical expression based on a two-region spherical model for a High Temperature Gas cooled Reactor ({HTGR}), is applied to a Pebble Bed Fluoride salt cooled High temperature Reactor ({PB}-{FHR}) to calculate the average Dancoff factor for fuel kernel with various coated particle densities. The results are compared with those obtained by the Monte Carlo ({MC}) method. It is found that there is a good agreement between the analytical and {MC}, which implies that the two-region spherical model for the Dancoff factor calculation is applicable to {PB}-{FHR}. The Dancoff factors with and without {FLiBe} salt are both evaluated and compared to analyze the influence of {FLiBe} salt with different numbers of coated particles. The Dancoff factor with {FLiBe} salt is smaller than that without {FLiBe} salt from ∼ 11\% to ∼ 3\% when the number of coated particles in a fuel pebble increases from 5000 to 60,000. In addition, the effects of temperature and volume fraction of {FLiBe} salt on Dancoff factor are analyzed. Afterwards, the sensitivity of the infinite multiplication factor (k∞) to the Dancoff factor for a fuel cell of {PB}-{FHR} is further analyzed by the neutron transport calculation with a new developed routine. It is found that the infinite multiplication factor increases almost linearly with the increase of Dancoff factor, and a higher density of coated particles will lead to a sharper variation of k∞ with Dancoff factor.},

	abstract = {A high temperature reactor ({HTR}) is a candidate to drive high temperature water-splitting using process heat. While both high temperature nuclear reactors and hydrogen generation plants have high individual degrees of development, study of the coupled plant is lacking. Particularly absent are considerations of the transient behavior of the coupled plant, as well as studies of the safety of the overall plant. The aim of this document is to contribute knowledge to the effort of nuclear hydrogen generation. In particular, this study regards identification of safety issues in the coupled plant and the transient modeling of some leading candidates for implementation in the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative ({NHI}). The Sulfur Iodine ({SI}) and Hybrid Sulfur ({HyS}) cycles are considered as candidate hydrogen generation schemes.

Three thermodynamically derived chemical reaction chamber models are coupled to a well-known reference design of a high temperature nuclear reactor. These chemical reaction chamber models have several dimensions of validation, including detailed steady state flowsheets, integrated loop test data, and bench scale chemical kinetics. The models and coupling scheme are presented here, as well as a transient test case initiated within the chemical plant. The 50\% feed flow failure within the chemical plant results in a slow loss-of-heat sink ({LOHS}) accident in the nuclear reactor. Due to the temperature feedback within the reactor core the nuclear reactor partially shuts down over 1500 s. Two distinct regions are identified within the coupled plant response: (1) immediate {LOHS} due to the loss of the sulfuric acid decomposition section and (2) continuing slow {LOHS} due to the chemical species cascade throughout the plant.},

	url = {http://escholarship.org/uc/item/0g2353c7},
	abstract = {The Pebble Bed Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({PB}-{AHTR}) is a pebble fueled, liquid salt cooled, high temperature nuclear reactor design that can be used for electricity generation or other applications requiring the availability of heat at elevated temperatures. A stage in the design evolution of this plant requires the analysis of the plant during a variety of potential transients to understand the primary and safety cooling system response. This study focuses on the performance of the passive safety cooling system with a dual purpose, to assess the capacity to maintain the core at safe temperatures and to assist the design process of this system to achieve this objective. The analysis requires the use of complex computational tools for simulation and verification using analytical solutions and comparisons with experimental data. This investigation builds upon previous detailed design work for the {PB}-{AHTR} components, including the core, reactivity control mechanisms and the intermediate heat exchanger, developed in 2008. In addition the study of this reference plant design employs a wealth of auxiliary information including thermal-hydraulic physical phenomena correlations for multiple geometries and thermophysical properties for the constituents of the plant. Finally, the set of performance requirements and limitations imposed from physical constrains and safety considerations provide with a criteria and metrics for acceptability of the design. The passive safety cooling system concept is turned into a detailed design as a result from this study. A methodology for the design of air-cooled passive safety systems was developed and a transient analysis of the plant, evaluating a scrammed loss of forced cooling event was performed. Furthermore, a design optimization study of the passive safety system and an approach for the validation and verification of the analysis is presented. This study demonstrates that the resulting point design responds properly to the transient event and maintains the core and reactor components at acceptable temperatures within allowable safety margins. It is also demonstrated that the transition from steady full-power, forced-cooling mode to steady decay-heat, natural-circulation mode is stable, predictable and well characterized.},

By using computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) methods and employing simplified body center cubic ({BCC}) and face center cubic ({FCC}) model, pressure drop and local mean Nusselt number are calculated. The simulation result shows that the high Prandtl number molten salt in packed bed has unique fluid-dynamics and thermodynamic properties. There are divergences between {CFD} results and empirical correlations\&\#x2019; predictions of pressure drop and local Nusselt numbers. Local pebble surface temperature distributions in several default conditions are investigated. Thermal removal capacities of molten salt are confirmed in the case of nominal condition; the pebble surface temperature under the condition of local power distortion shows the tolerance of pebble in extreme neutron dose exposure. The numerical experiments of local pebble insufficient cooling indicate that in the molten salt cooled pebble bed reactor, the pebble surface temperature is not very sensitive to loss of partial coolant. The methods and results of this paper would be useful for optimum designs and safety analysis of molten salt cooled pebble bed reactors.},

	abstract = {A reduction of the power peak in the core of High Temperature pebble-bed reactors is attractive to decrease the maximum fuel temperature and to increase fuel performance. A calculation procedure was developed, which combines fuel depletion, neutronics and thermal–hydraulics to investigate the impact of a certain (re)loading scheme for the pebble-bed type {HTR}. The procedure has been applied to a model of the Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (400 {MW}) design.

This paper shows that an important reduction in axial power peaking can be achieved by adopting a multi-pass recycling scheme for the pebbles. By dividing the core into several radial fuel zones in combination with multi-pass recycling the power profile can be flattened in the radial direction. For a core with two fuel zones the impact on the keff and maximum power density as a function of the zone size has been investigated. A heuristic method has been used to find the optimal pebble loading pattern for several (re)loading schemes. Using this method a reduction of the maximum power density from 10.0 to 8.2 {MW}/m3 has been achieved for a core with three radial fuel zones.

The effects of the improved power profiles on the fuel temperature during normal operation and a Depressurized Loss Of Coolant ({DLOFC}) accident have been analyzed. It was found that the optimized power profile results in a reduction of the maximum fuel temperature of 80 °C and 300 °C for normal operation and {DLOFC} conditions, respectively.},

	url = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008PhDT........99F},
	abstract = {This study investigated the neutronic characteristics of the Pebble Bed Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({PB}-{AHTR}), a novel nuclear reactor concept that combines liquid salt (7LiF-{BeF}2---flibe) cooling and {TRISO} coated-particle fuel technology. The use of flibe enables operation at high power density and atmospheric pressure and improves passive decay-heat removal capabilities, but flibe, unlike conventional helium coolant, is not transparent to neutrons. The flibe occupies 40\% of the {PB}-{AHTR} core volume and absorbs ˜8\% of the neutrons, but also acts as an effective neutron moderator. Two novel methodologies were developed for calculating the time dependent and equilibrium core composition: (1) a simplified single pebble model that is relatively fast; (2) a full 3D core model that is accurate and flexible but computationally intensive. A parametric analysis was performed spanning a wide range of fuel kernel diameters and graphite-to-heavy metal atom ratios to determine the attainable burnup and reactivity coefficients. Using 10\% enriched uranium ˜130 {GWd}/{tHM} burnup was found to be attainable, when the graphite-to-heavy metal atom ratio (C/{HM}) is in the range of 300 to 400. At this or smaller C/{HM} ratio all reactivity coefficients examined---coolant temperature, coolant small and full void, fuel temperature, and moderator temperature, were found to be negative. The {PB}-{AHTR} performance was compared to that of alternative options for {HTRs}, including the helium-cooled pebble-bed reactor and prismatic fuel reactors, both gas-cooled and flibe-cooled. The attainable burnup of all designs was found to be similar. The {PB}-{AHTR} generates at least 30\% more energy per pebble than the He-cooled pebble-bed reactor. Compared to {LWRs} the {PB}-{AHTR} requires 30\% less natural uranium and 20\% less separative work per unit of electricity generated. For deep burn {TRU} fuel made from recycled {LWR} spent fuel, it was found that in a single pass through the core ˜66\% of the {TRU} can be transmuted; this burnup is slightly superior to that attainable in helium-cooled reactors. A preliminary analysis of the modular variant for the {PB}-{AHTR} investigated the triple heterogeneity of this design and determined its performance characteristics.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-physics modelling ({MPM}) approach developed for the study of the dynamics of the Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}), which has been reconsidered as one of the future nuclear power plants in the framework of the Generation {IV} International Forum for its several potentialities. The proposed multi-physics modelling is aimed at the description of the coupling between heat transfer, fluid dynamics and neutronics characteristics in a typical {MSR} core channel, taking into account the spatial effects of the most relevant physical quantities. In particular, as far as molten salt thermo-hydrodynamics is concerned, Navier–Stokes equations are used with the turbulence treatment according to the {RANS} (Reynolds Averaged Navier–Stokes) scheme, while the heat transfer is taken into account through the energy balance equations for the fuel salt and the graphite. As far as neutronics is concerned, the two-group diffusion theory is adopted, where the group constants (computed by means of the neutron transport code {NEWT} of {SCALE} 5.1) are included into the model in order to describe the neutron flux and the delayed neutron precursor distributions, the system time constants, and the temperature feedback effects of both graphite and fuel salt. The developed {MPM} approach is implemented in the unified simulation environment offered by {COMSOL} Multiphysics®, and is applied to study the behaviour of the system in steady-state conditions and under several transients (i.e., reactivity insertion due to control rod movements, fuel mass flow rate variations due to the change of the pump working conditions, presence of periodic perturbations), pointing out some advantages offered with respect to the conventional approaches employed in literature for the {MSRs}.},

	abstract = {The concept of the molten salt reactor ({MSR}) refuses to go away. The Generation-{IV} process lists the {MSR} as one of the six concepts to be considered for extending fuel resources. Good fuel utilization and good economics are required to meet the often-cited goal of 10 {TWe} globally and 1 {TWe} for the {US} by non-carbon energy sources in this century by nuclear fission. Strong incentives for the molten salt reactor design are its good fuel utilization, good economics, amazing fuel flexibility and promised large benefits. It can:• use thorium or uranium; • be designed with lots of graphite to have a fairly thermal neutron spectrum or without graphite moderator to have an epithermal neutron spectrum; • fission uranium isotopes and plutonium isotopes; • produces less long-lived wastes than today’s reactors by a factor of 10–100; • operate with non-weapon grade fissile fuel, or in suitable sites it can operate with enrichment between reactor-grade and weapon grade fissile fuel; • be a breeder or near breeder; • operate at temperature \&gt;1100 °C if carbon composites are successfully developed. Enhancing 232U content in the uranium to over 500 ppm makes the fuel undesirable for weapons, but it should not detract from its economic use in liquid fuel reactors: a big advantage in nonproliferation. Economics of the {MSR} are enhanced by operating at low pressure and high temperature and may even lead to the preferred route to hydrogen production. The cost of the electricity produced from low enriched fuel averaged over the life of the entire process, has been predicted to be about 10\% lower than that from {LWRs}, and 20\% lower for high-enriched fuel, with uncertainties of about 10\%. The development cost has been estimated at about 1 B\$ (e.g., a 100 M\$/year base program for 10 years) not including construction of a series of reactors leading up to the deployment of multiple commercial units at an assumed cost of 9 B\$ (450 M\$/year over 20 years). A benefit of liquid fuel is that smaller power reactors can faithfully test features of larger reactors, thereby reducing the number of steps to commercial deployment. Assuming electricity is worth \$ 50 per {MWe} h, then 50 years of 10 {TWe} power level would be worth 200 trillion dollars. If the {MSR} could be developed and proven for 10 B\$ and would save 10\% over its alternative, the total savings over 50 years would be 20 trillion dollars: a good return on investment even considering discounted future savings. The incentives for the molten salt reactor are so strong and its relevance to our energy policy and national security are so compelling that one asks, “Why has the reactor not already been developed?”},

	abstract = {The neutron kinetics of the molten salt reactor is significantly influenced by the fuel salt flow, which leads to the analysis methods for the conventional reactors using solid fuels not being applicable for the molten salt reactors. In this study, a neutron kinetic model considering the fuel salt flow is established based on the neutron diffusion theory, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for the fast and thermal neutron fluxes and six-group balance equations for delayed neutron precursors. The temperature feedback on the neutron kinetics is considered by introducing a heat transfer model in the core, in which the group constants which are dependent on the temperature are calculated by the code {DRAGON}. The mathematical equations are discretized and numerically calculated by developing a code, in which the fully implicit scheme is adopted for the time-dependent terms, and the power law scheme is for the convection–diffusion terms. The neutron kinetics is conducted during three transient conditions including the rods drop transient, the pump coastdown transient and the inlet temperature drop transient. The relative power changes and the distributions of the temperature, neutron fluxes and delayed neutron precursors under these three different transient conditions are obtained in the study. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of this new generation reactor.},

	abstract = {The one-group diffusion theory of molten salt reactors in a homogeneous reactor model is revisited. First, the integral terms in the equation for the flux, obtained after the elimination of the delayed neutron precursors, are given a physical interpretation. This gives an understanding of the physical meaning of the concept of infinite fuel recirculation velocity, which eliminates one of the two integral terms, introduced in earlier work in order to find analytic solutions. In the light of the physical interpretation, another approximation, representing a different limiting case can be defined, corresponding to long recirculation times, i.e. no recirculation of the delayed neutron precursors to the core. This approximation incurs the neglecting of the other integral term, and it can also be solved analytically. Finally it is shown that the full equation, without neglecting any of the integral terms, has also a compact analytical solution and it is demonstrated how the case of the infinite velocity can be obtained as a limit case of the full solution. The analytical solutions open up the possibility to study a number of questions in analytical form, such as the calculation of the point kinetic response of the reactor, or the effect of the different boundary conditions. As an illustration, the solutions corresponding to the vanishing of the flux at the extrapolated boundary are compared to those obtained from the logarithmic boundary conditions.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle is an established field with multiple players. Prior development work has utilized tech- niques such as system dynamics to provide a solution structure for the matching of supply and demand in these simulations. In general, however, simulation infrastructure development has occured in relatively closed circles, each effort having unique considerations as to the cases which are desired to be modeled. Accordingly, individual simulators tend to have their design decisions driven by specific use cases. Presented in this work is a proposed supply and demand matching algorithm that lever- ages the techniques of the well-studied field of mathematical programming. A generic approach is achieved by treating fa- cilities as individual entities and actors in the supply-demand market which denote preferences amongst commodities. Using such a framework allows for varying levels of interaction fi- delity, ranging from low-fidelity, quick solutions to high-fidelity solutions that model individual transactions (e.g. at the fuel- assembly level). The power of the technique is that it allows such flexibility while still treating the problem in a generic man- ner, encapsulating simulation engine design decisions in such a way that future simulation requirements can be relatively easily added when needed.},

The proposed two-step approach includes at the first step the identification of software failure modes on the basis of review of operating experience gained with software-based I\&C systems and equipment. All probable software failures in software-based I\&C systems should be identified and classified according to e. g. the concerned system, the observed software failure mode and to their actual and potential safety relevance. In a second step an evaluation of the potential impact of identified safety relevant software failure modes in a software-based I\&C system shall be performed. The evaluation shall be done by means of a failure mode and effects analysis ({FMEA}) using a generic model of the software-based I\&C system, i.e. software failure modes are postulated in the I\&C system and their potential safety-relevant impact is analyzed.},

	abstract = {A transient is defined as an event when a plant proceeds from a normal state to an abnormal state. In nuclear power plants ({NPPs}), recognizing the types of transients during early stages, for taking appropriate actions, is critical. Furthermore, classification of a novel transient as “don't know”, if it is not included within {NPPs} collected knowledge, is necessary. To fulfill these requirements, transient identification techniques as a method to recognize and to classify abnormal conditions are extensively used. The studies revealed that model-based methods are not suitable candidates for transient identification in {NPPs}. Hitherto, data-driven methods, especially artificial neural networks ({ANN}), and other soft computing techniques such as fuzzy logic, genetic algorithm ({GA}), particle swarm optimization ({PSO}), quantum evolutionary algorithm ({QEA}), expert systems are mostly investigated. Furthermore, other methods such as hidden Markov model ({HMM}), and support vector machines ({SVM}) are considered for transient identification in {NPPs}. By these modern techniques, {NPPs} safety, due to accidents recognition by symptoms rather than events, is improved. Transient identification is expected to become increasingly important as the next generation reactors being designed to operate for extended fuel cycles with less operators' oversight. In this paper, recent studies related to the advanced techniques for transient identification in {NPPs} are presented and their differences are illustrated.},

While practical applications of model-based methods are very limited, various data-driven methods and signal-based methods have been applied for monitoring key subsystems in {NPPs}. In this paper, six areas of such applications are considered. They are: instrument calibration monitoring, instrumentation channel dynamic performance monitoring, equipment monitoring, reactor core monitoring, loose part monitoring, and transient identification. The principles of using {FDD} methods in these applications are explained and recent studies of advanced {FDD} methods are examined.

	abstract = {The U.S. Department of Energy recently filed a motion to withdraw the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission license application for the High Level Waste Repository at
Yucca Mountain in Nevada. As the U.S. has focused exclusively on geologic disposal in
shallow mined repositories for the past two decades, an examination of disposal
alternatives will be necessary should the Yucca Mountain Project be terminated. This
provides an opportunity to study other promising waste disposal technologies. One such
technology is the use of very deep boreholes in monolithic granite to permanently
segregate high level wastes from the biosphere. While research in this field has focused
on vertical emplacement techniques, horizontal emplacement offers the significant
advantages of allowing increased emplacement lengths without crushing of the waste
package and the use of a single vertical shaft for drilling multiple horizontal shafts. This
project examines the application of currently deployed oil and natural gas directional
drilling techniques to borehole design. A large trade-space of potential borehole
configurations is evaluated and a final design selected using the "V-{DeepBoRe}" code, a
Monte-Carlo simulation based cost model for borehole construction and waste package
emplacement. Waste repackaging and reconstitution is evaluated to permit deployment
of waste in borehole diameters too small for intact fuel assemblies. A 5 m x 195.26 mm
({OD}) cylindrical waste package is designed using P-110 drill string steel to meet strength
and thermal loading requirements; fuel centerline temperatures are shown to not exceed
190'C by analytical and finite element methods. The total cost of a national borehole
repository (including drilling, consolidating and encapsulating the fuel, emplacement, and
closure) is shown to fall below \$63/{kgHM}, well within the capacity of the {DOE}
Commercial Spent Nuclear Fuel Waste Fund.},

	abstract = {A molten salt reactor ({MSR}) is a class of generation {IV} nuclear fission reactor in which the primary nuclear reactor coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a molten salt mixture. {MSRs} can run at higher temperatures than water-cooled reactors for a higher thermodynamic efficiency, while staying at low vapour pressure.
The nuclear fuel may be solid or dissolved in the coolant. In many designs the nuclear fuel dissolved in the coolant is uranium tetrafluoride ({UF}4). The fluid becomes critical in a graphite core that serves as the moderator. Some solid-fuel designs propose ceramic fuel dispersed in a graphite matrix, with the molten salt providing low pressure, high temperature cooling. The salts are much more efficient than compressed helium (another potential coolant in Generation {IV} reactor designs) at removing heat from the core, reducing the need for pumping and piping and reducing the core size.
The concept was established in the 1950s. The early Aircraft Reactor Experiment (1954) was primarily motivated by the small size that the design could provide, while the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (1965–1969) was a prototype for a thorium fuel cycle breeder reactor nuclear power plant. The increased research into Generation {IV} reactor designs included a renewed interest in the technology.},

This chapter is devoted to the fuels and coolants of the molten salt reactor ({MSR}), which belongs to one of the six nuclear reactor concepts considered in the Generation {IV} initiative. The chapter is divided into ten different sections and starts with an introduction (Section 3.13.1), in which the general characteristics of the {MSR} are described. This is followed by a report (Section 3.13.2) on the historical developments of this reactor concept, with the main emphasis on the work performed at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the 1960s and 1970s. Section 3.13.3 briefly explains the current {MSR} concepts and their applications as either breeder designs or actinide burner concepts in the management of the long-lived actinides. Section 3.13.4 summarizes the physicochemical properties of typical fuels and coolants, based on the critical evaluation of available experimental data of the fluoride systems. This section is divided into several subsections based on the properties discussed, giving first a brief description of the structure of the fluoride liquids, followed by the description of various phase diagrams. Furthermore, the solubility of actinide fluorides in the fuel matrix is given, as well as information about the density, viscosity, heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the vapor pressure. One of the key issues is the understanding of the fuel behavior under irradiating conditions. This is briefly discussed in Section 3.13.7. Section 3.13.8 is related to the fission products and their behavior in the fluoride fuel matrix with respect to their solubility, and Section 3.13.9 addresses the corrosion effects of the fuel salt on the structural materials.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
The fluoride salt cooled high temperature reactor ({FHR}) is a class of fission reactor designs that use liquid fluoride salt coolant, {TRISO} coated particle fuel, and graphite moderator. Heavy ion fusion ({HIF}) can likewise make use of liquid fluoride salts, to create thick or thin liquid layers to protect structures in the target chamber from ablation by target X-rays and damage from fusion neutron irradiation. This presentation summarizes ongoing work in support of design development and safety analysis of {FHR} systems. Development work for fluoride salt systems with application to both {FHR} and {HIF} includes thermal-hydraulic modeling and experimentation, salt chemistry control, tritium management, salt corrosion of metallic alloys, and development of major components (e.g., pumps, heat exchangers) and gas-Brayton cycle power conversion systems. In support of {FHR} development, a thermal-hydraulic experimental test bay for separate effects ({SETs}) and integral effect tests ({IETs}) was built at {UC} Berkeley, and a second {IET} facility is under design. The experiments investigate heat transfer and fluid dynamics and they make use of oils as simulant fluids at reduced scale, temperature, and power of the prototypical salt-cooled system. With direct application to {HIF}, vortex tube flow was investigated in scaled experiments with mineral oil. Liquid jets response to impulse loading was likewise studied using water as a simulant fluid. A set of four workshops engaging industry and national laboratory experts were completed in 2012, with the goal of developing a technology pathway to the design and licensing of a commercial {FHR}. The pathway will include experimental and modeling efforts at universities and national laboratories, requirements for a component test facility for reliability testing of fluoride salt equipment at prototypical conditions, requirements for an {FHR} test reactor, and development of a pre-conceptual design for a commercial reactor.},

	abstract = {Many countries produce significant quantities of nuclear waste which will have to be permanently and safely placed in a repository. We develop a mixed integer program that determines where to place each waste package of a specific waste type in a given time period with the goal of minimizing heat load concentration within a repository. Operational constraints include: (1) heat load limitations, (2) location and time at which waste packages can be placed, and (3) the number of waste packages that must be placed based on type and time period. Although applicable to other settings, we use the Yucca Mountain repository in Nevada as a case study. Each of the three objectives used for minimizing heat load concentration improves upon existing greedy and sequential filling methods. Existing filling methods give at least a 17 \% to an 873 \% higher, i.e., worse, heat load concentration in the repository with respect to these objectives than do optimal methods. Enhancements, i.e., symmetry reduction constraints, perturbations, and heuristics, increase the size of solvable problem instances. This research can be applied to any deep geologic repository planned for operation around the world with slight modifications to incorporate site-specific objectives and constraints.},

	abstract = {The nuclear fuel cycle is the series of stages that nuclear fuel materials go through in a cradle to grave framework. The Once Through Cycle ({OTC}) is the current fuel cycle implemented in the United States; in which an appropriate form of the fuel is irradiated through a nuclear reactor only once before it is disposed of as waste. The discharged fuel contains materials that can be suitable for use as fuel. Thus, different types of fuel recycling technologies may be introduced in order to more fully utilize the energy potential of the fuel, or reduce the environmental impacts and proliferation concerns about the discarded fuel materials. Nuclear fuel cycle systems analysis is applied in this paper to attain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of fuel cycle alternatives. Through the use of the nuclear fuel cycle analysis code {CAFCA} (Code for Advanced Fuel Cycle Analysis), the impact of a number of recycling technologies and the associated fuel cycle options is explored in the context of the U.S. energy scenario over 100 years. Particular focus is given to the quantification of Uranium utilization, the amount of Transuranic Material ({TRU}) generated and the economics of the different options compared to the base-line case, the {OTC} option. It is concluded that {LWRs} and the {OTC} are likely to dominate the nuclear energy supply system for the period considered due to limitations on availability of {TRU} to initiate recycling technologies. While the introduction of U-235 initiated fast reactors can accelerate their penetration of the nuclear energy system, their higher capital cost may lead to continued preference for the {LWR}-{OTC} cycle.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a deterministic performance assessment for spent fuel from deep-burn modular hightemperature reactors ({DBMHRs}) in the proposed Yucca Mountain repository. Typical {DBMHR} designs utilize fuel elements manufactured from graphite. The fuel itself is made of {TRISO} particles containing the fissile material. The performance of the {DBMHR} spent fuel ({DBSF}) was evaluated in terms of the annual dose to the reasonably maximally exposed individual ({RMEI}) under various hydrogeological conditions. Part of this evaluation was an analysis of the graphite waste matrix and of the {TRISO} particles under repository conditions, the result of which indicates that the lifetime of the graphite matrix greatly exceeds that of the {TRISO} particles and that it is the graphite, not the {TRISO} particles, that serves to sequester the radionuclides within the fuel matrix. Under all 14 cases considered, {DBSF} is seen to comply with the annual dose standards set in Part 197 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, for exposure via groundwater contamination under current climatic conditions. Parametric studies for the effect of waste matrix lifetime on annual dose received by the {RMEI} indicate that repository performance is sensitively linked to waste matrix durability because most radionuclides including actinides are likely to be released congruently with the graphite matrix.},

	abstract = {Bottom-up energy system models rely on cost optimization to produce energy scenarios that inform policy analyses, debates and decisions. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of cost optimization and questions whether cost-optimal scenarios are adequate proxies of the real-world energy transition. Evidence from ex-post modeling shows that cost optimization does not approximate the real-world {UK} electricity system transition in 1990–2014. The deviation in cumulative total system costs from the cost-optimal scenario in 1990–2014 is equal to 9–23\% under various technology, cost, demand, and discount rate assumptions. In fact, cost-optimal scenarios are shown to gloss over a large share of uncertainty that arises due to deviations from cost optimality. Exploration of large numbers of near-optimal scenarios under parametric uncertainty can give indication of the bounds or envelope of predictability of the real-world transition. Concrete suggestions are then made how to improve bottom-up energy system models to better deal with the vast uncertainty around the future energy transition. The paper closes with a reflective discussion on the tension between predictive and exploratory use of energy system models.},

	abstract = {High level waste ({HLW}) management requires being able to demonstrate the safety over geological timescales, typically 1 My. This can be made possible by using a rigorous, complex and iterative scientific approach called Long-term Behavior Science. The methodology relies on experiments and modelling. A large multi-scale approach is required and involves a mechanistic understanding of the key phenomena controlling the source term (i.e. the flux of radionuclides released from the waste as a function of time), as well as parametric studies, integrated and in situ tests. As a result, it is eventually possible to develop an operational model based on clever simplifications of a very complex reality, ensuring that predictions will always remain conservative despite conceptual and numerical uncertainties. Finally, predictive models must be validated based on the study of natural or archaeological analogues. In this paper, we show how this methodology can be applied by selecting examples of spent nuclear fuel and {HLW} glass.},

The relative durability, predicted from thermodynamic calculations, correlates directly with the experimentally observed release of silicon to the leaching solution in short-term laboratory tests. By choosing natural glasses and ancient glasses, whose long-term performance is known and which bracket the durability of waste glasses, the long-term stability of nuclear waste glasses can be interpolated. The current Savannah River defense waste glass formulation is a durable as natural basalt from the Hanford Reservation (106 y old). The thermodynamic hydration energy is shown to be related to the bond energetics of the glass.},

	abstract = {Even bad code can function. But if code isn’t clean, it can bring a development organization to its knees. Every year, countless hours and significant resources are lost because of poorly written code. But it doesn’t have to be that way. Noted software expert Robert C. Martin presents a revolutionary paradigm with  Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship . Martin has teamed up with his colleagues from Object Mentor to distill their best agile practice of cleaning code “on the fly” into a book that will instill within you the values of a software craftsman and make you a better programmer—but only if you work at it. What kind of work will you be doing? You’ll be reading code—lots of code. And you will be challenged to think about what’s right about that code, and what’s wrong with it. More importantly, you will be challenged to reassess your professional values and your commitment to your craft.   Clean Code  is divided into three parts. The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code. Readers will come away from this book understanding  How to tell the difference between good and bad code How to write good code and how to transform bad code into good code How to create good names, good functions, good objects, and good classes How to format code for maximum readability How to implement complete error handling without obscuring code logic How to unit test and practice test-driven development This book is a must for any developer, software engineer, project manager, team lead, or systems analyst with an interest in producing better code.},

	title = {Working Effectively with Legacy Code},
	isbn = {978-0-13-117705-5},
	abstract = {Preface Do you remember the first program you wrote? I remember mine. It was a little graphics program I wrote on an early {PC}. I started programming later than most of my friends. Sure, I d seen computers when I was a kid. I remember being really impressed by a minicomputer I once saw in an office, but for years I never had a chance to even sit at a computer. Later, when I was a teenager, some friends of mine bought a couple of the first {TRS}-80s. I was interested, but I was actually a bit apprehensive, too. I knew that if I started to play with computers, I d get sucked into it. It just looked too cool. I don t know why I knew myself so well, but I held back. Later, in college, a roommate of mine had a computer, and I bought a C compiler so that I could teach myself programming. Then it began. I stayed up night after night trying things out, poring through the source code of the emacs editor that came with the compiler. It was addictive, it was challenging, and I loved it. I hope you ve had experiences like thismdjust the raw joy of making things work on a computer. Nearly every programmer I ask has. That joy is part of what got us into this work, but where is it day to day? A few years ago, I gave my friend Erik Meade a call after I d finished work one night. I knew that Erik had just started a consulting gig with a new team, so I asked him, "How are they doing?" He said, "They re writing legacy code, man." That was one of the few times in my life when I was sucker-punched by a coworker s statement. I felt it right in my gut. Erik had given words to the precise feeling that I often get when I visit teams for the first time. They are trying very hard, but at the end of the day, because of schedule pressure, the weight of history, or a lack of any better code to compare their efforts to, many people are writing legacy code. What is legacy code? I ve used the term without defining it. Let s look at the strict definition: Legacy code is code that we ve gotten from someone else. Maybe our company acquired code from another company; maybe people on the original team moved on to other projects. Legacy code is somebody else s code. But in programmer-speak, the term means much more than that. The term legacy codehas taken on more shades of meaning and more weight over time. What do you think about when you hear the term legacy code? If you are at all like me, you think of tangled, unintelligible structure, code that you have to change but don t really understand. You think of sleepless nights trying to add in features that should be easy to add, and you think of demoralization, the sense that everyone on the team is so sick of a code base that it seems beyond care, the sort of code that you just wish would die. Part of you feels bad for even thinking about making it better. It seems unworthy of your efforts. That definition of legacy code has nothing to do with who wrote it. Code can degrade in many ways, and many of them have nothing to do with whether the code came from another team. In the industry, legacy codeis often used as a slang term for difficult-to-change code that we don t understand. But over years of working with teams, helping them get past serious code problems, I ve arrived at a different definition. To me, legacy codeis simply code without tests. I ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book: Code without tests is bad code. It doesn t matter how well written it is; it doesn t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don t know if our code is getting better or worse. You might think that this is severe. What about clean code? If a code base is very clean and well structured, isn t that enough? Well, make no mistake. I love clean code. I love it more than most people I know, but while clean code is good, it s not enough. Teams take serious chances when they try to make large changes without tests. It is like doing aerial gymnastics without a net. It requires incredible skill and a clear understanding of what can happen at every step. Knowing precisely what will happen if you change a couple of variables is often like knowing whether another gymnast is going to catch your arms after you come out of a somersault. If you are on a team with code that clear, you are in a better position than most programmers. In my work, I ve noticed that teams with that degree of clarity in all of their code are rare. They seem like a statistical anomaly. And, you know what? If they don t have supporting tests, their code changes still appear to be slower than those of teams that do. Yes, teams do get better and start to write clearer code, but it takes a long time for older code to get clearer. In many cases, it will never happen completely. Because of this, I have no problem defining legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution. I ve been talking about tests quite a bit so far, but this book is not about testing. This book is about being able to confidently make changes in any code base. In the following chapters, I describe techniques that you can use to understand code, get it under test, refactor it, and add features. One thing that you will notice as you read this book is that it is not a book about pretty code. The examples that I use in the book are fabricated because I work under nondisclosure agreements with clients. But in many of the examples, I ve tried to preserve the spirit of code that I ve seen in the field. I won t say that the examples are always representative. There certainly are oases of great code out there, but, frankly, there are also pieces of code that are far worse than anything I can use as an example in this book. Aside from client confidentiality, I simply couldn t put code like that in this book without boring you to tears and burying important points in a morass of detail. As a result, many of the examples are relatively brief. If you look at one of them and think "No, he doesn t understandmdmy methods are much larger than that and much worse," please look at the advice that I am giving at face value and see if it applies, even if the example seems simpler. The techniques here have been tested on substantially large pieces of code. It is just a limitation of the book format that makes examples smaller. In particular, when you see ellipses el in a code fragment like this, you can read them as "insert 500 lines of ugly code here": m\_pDispatcher-{\textgreater}register listener ;...m\_nMargins++; re{\textgreater}If this book is not about pretty code, it is even less about pretty design. Good design should be a goal for all of us, but in legacy code, it is something that we arrive at in discrete steps. In some of the chapters, I describe ways of adding new code to existing code bases and show how to add it with good design principles in mind. You can start to grow areas of very good high-quality code in legacy code bases, but don t be surprised if some of the steps you take to make changes involve making some code slightly uglier. This work is like surgery. We have to make incisions, and we have to move through the guts and suspend some aesthetic judgment. Could this patient s major organs and viscera be better than they are? Yes. So do we just forget about his immediate problem, sew him up again, and tell him to eat right and train for a marathon? We could, but what we really need to do is take the patient as he is, fix what s wrong, and move him to a healthier state. He might never become an Olympic athlete, but we can t let "best" be the enemy of "better." Code bases can become healthier and easier to work in. When a patient feels a little better, often that is the time when you can help him make commitments to a healthier life style. That is what we are shooting for with legacy code. We are trying to get to the point at which we are used to ease; we expect it and actively attempt to make code change easier. When we can sustain that sense on a team, design gets better. The techniques I describe are ones that I ve discovered and learned with coworkers and clients over the course of years working with clients to try to establish control over unruly code bases. I got into this legacy code emphasis accidentally. When I first started working with Object Mentor, the bulk of my work involved helping teams with serious problems develop their skills and interactions to the point that they could regularly deliver quality code. We often used Extreme Programming practices to help teams take control of their work, collaborate intensively, and deliver. I often feel that Extreme Programming is less a way to develop software than it is a way to make a well-jelled work team that just happens to deliver great software every two weeks. From the beginning, though, there was a problem. Many of the first {XP} projects were "greenfield" projects. The clients I was seeing had significantly large code bases, and they were in trouble. They needed some way to get control of their work and start to deliver. Over time, I found that I was doing the same things over and over again with clients. This sense culminated in some work I was doing with a team in the financial industry. Before I d arrived, they d realized that unit testing was a great thing, but the tests that they were executing were full scenario tests that made multiple trips to a database and exercised large chunks of code. The tests were hard to write, and the team didn t run them very often because they took so long to run. As I sat down with them to break dependencies and get smaller chunks of code under test, I had a terrible sense of deasjaag vu. It seemed that I was doing this sort of work with every team I met, and it was the sort of thing that no one really wanted to think about. It was just the grunge work that you do when you want to start working with your code in a controlled way, if you know how to do it. I decided then that it was worth really reflecting on how we were solving these problems and writing them down so that teams could get a leg up and start to make their code bases easier to live in. A note about the examples: I ve used examples in several different programming languages. The bulk of the examples are written in Java, C++, and C. I picked Java because it is a very common language, and I included C++ because it presents some special challenges in a legacy environment. I picked C because it highlights many of the problems that come up in procedural legacy code. Among them, these languages cover much of the spectrum of concerns that arise in legacy code. However, if the languages you using are not covered in the examples, take a look at them anyway. Many of the techniques that I cover can be used in other languages, such as Delphi, Visual Basic, {COBOL}, and {FORTRAN}. I hope that you find the techniques in this book helpful and that they allow you to get back to what is fun about programming. Programming can be very rewarding and enjoyable work. If you don t feel that in your day-to-day work, I hope that the techniques I offer you in this book help you find it and grow it on your team. Acknowledgements First of all, I owe a serious debt to my wife, Ann, and my children, Deborah and Ryan. Their love and support made this book and all of the learning that preceded it possible. I d also like to thank "Uncle Bob" Martin, president and founder of Object Mentor. His rigorous pragmatic approach to development and design, separating the critical from the inconsequential, gave me something to latch upon about 10 years ago, back when it seemed that I was about to drown in a wave of unrealistic advice. And thanks, Bob, for giving me the opportunity to see more code and work with more people over the past five years than I ever imagined possible. I also have to thank Kent Beck, Ron Jeffries, and Ward Cunningham for offering me advice at times and teaching me a great deal about team work, design, and programming. Special thanks to all of the people who reviewed the drafts. The official reviewers were Sven Gorts, Robert C. Martin, Erik Meade, and Bill Wake; the unofficial reviewers were Dr. Robert Koss, James Grenning, Lowell Lindstrom, Micah Martin, Russ Rufer and the Silicon Valley Patterns Group, and James Newkirk. Thanks also to reviewers of the very early drafts I placed on the Internet. Their feedback significantly affected the direction of the book after I reorganized its format. I apologize in advance to any of you I may have left out. The early reviewers were: Darren Hobbs, Martin Lippert, Keith Nicholas, Phlip Plumlee, C. Keith Ray, Robert Blum, Bill Burris, William Caputo, Brian Marick, Steve Freeman, David Putman, Emily Bache, Dave Astels, Russel Hill, Christian Sepulveda, and Brian Christopher Robinson. Thanks also to Joshua Kerievsky who gave a key early review and Jeff Langr who helped with advice and spot reviews all through the process. The reviewers helped me polish the draft considerably, but if there are errors remaining, they are solely mine. Thanks to Martin Fowler, Ralph Johnson, Bill Opdyke, Don Roberts, and John Brant for their work in the area of refactoring. It has been inspirational. I also owe a special debt to Jay Packlick, Jacques Morel, and Kelly Mower of Sabre Holdings, and Graham Wright of Workshare Technology for their support and feedback. Special thanks also to Paul Petralia, Michelle Vincenti, Lori Lyons, Krista Hansing, and the rest of the team at Prentice-Hall. Thank you, Paul, for all of the help and encouragement that this first-time author needed. Special thanks also to Gary and Joan Feathers, April Roberts, Dr. Raimund Ege, David Lopez de Quintana, Carlos Perez, Carlos M. Rodriguez, and the late Dr. John C. Comfort for help and encouragement over the years.I also have to thank to Brian Button for the example in Chapter {XX}, I m Changing the Same Code All Over the Place. He wrote that code in about an hour when we were developing a refactoring course together, and it s become my favorite piece of teaching code. Also, special thanks to Janik Top, whose instrumental De Futuraserved as the soundtrack for my last few weeks of work on this book. Finally, I d like to thank everyone whom I ve worked with over the past few years whose insights and challenges strengthened the material in this book.

Now that Linux is an established player both as a server and on the desktop Learning the bash Shell has been updated and refreshed to account for all the latest changes.  Indeed, this third edition serves as the most valuable guide yet to the bash shell.As any good programmer knows, the first thing users of the Linux operating system come face to face with is the shell the {UNIX} term for a user interface to the system.  In other words, it's what lets you communicate with the computer via the keyboard and display.  Mastering the bash shell might sound fairly simple but it isn't.  In truth, there are many complexities that need careful explanation, which is just what Learning the bash Shell provides.If you are new to shell programming, the book provides an excellent introduction, covering everything from the most basic to the most advanced features.  And if you've been writing shell scripts for years, it offers a great way to find out what the new shell offers.  Learning the bash Shell is also full of practical examples of shell commands and programs that will make everyday use of Linux that much easier.  With this book, programmers will learn:How to install bash as your login {shellThe} basics of interactive shell use, including {UNIX} file and directory structures, standard I/O, and background {jobsCommand} line editing, history substitution, and key {bindingsHow} to customize your shell environment without {programmingThe} nuts and bolts of basic shell programming, flow control structures, command-line options and typed {variablesProcess} handling, from job control to processes, coroutines and {subshellsDebugging} techniques, such as trace and verbose {modesTechniques} for implementing system-wide shell customization and features related to system security},

	doi = {10.1371/journal.pone.0026828},
	abstract = {Background
The widespread reluctance to share published research data is often hypothesized to be due to the authors' fear that reanalysis may expose errors in their work or may produce conclusions that contradict their own. However, these hypotheses have not previously been studied systematically.


Methods and Findings
We related the reluctance to share research data for reanalysis to 1148 statistically significant results reported in 49 papers published in two major psychology journals. We found the reluctance to share data to be associated with weaker evidence (against the null hypothesis of no effect) and a higher prevalence of apparent errors in the reporting of statistical results. The unwillingness to share data was particularly clear when reporting errors had a bearing on statistical significance.


Conclusions
Our findings on the basis of psychological papers suggest that statistical results are particularly hard to verify when reanalysis is more likely to lead to contrasting conclusions. This highlights the importance of establishing mandatory data archiving policies.},

	abstract = {Primarily because of its young age, Python is still a language that people only discover after having digested a few others: while many of its users love it enthusiastically, almost nobody is a native speaker of it, in the sense of having been exposed to it before any other. As computer literacy evolves from desirable to necessary for people from all backgrounds, computer professionals and academics are responsible for taking a long-term view on how best to educate the next few generations of computer users. Form shapes contents, so the influence of a clean yet expressive first language in establishing good mental models and programming habits should not be underestimated. This paper discusses how Python, with its high level of abstraction and judicious balance of simplicity, conciseness and versatility, is an excellent choice to introduce the fundamental ideas of the art of programming. 1},

	shorttitle = {The Making of the Atomic Bomb},
	abstract = {Twenty-five years after its initial publication, The Making of the Atomic Bomb remains the definitive history of nuclear weapons and the Manhattan Project. From the turn-of-the-century discovery of nuclear energy to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan, Richard Rhodes’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book details the science, the people, and the socio-political realities that led to the development of the atomic bomb.This sweeping account begins in the 19th century, with the discovery of nuclear fission, and continues to World War Two and the Americans’ race to beat Hitler’s Nazis. That competition launched the Manhattan Project and the nearly overnight construction of a vast military-industrial complex that culminated in the fateful dropping of the first bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.Reading like a character-driven suspense novel, the book introduces the players in this saga of physics, politics, and human psychology—from {FDR} and Einstein to the visionary scientists who pioneered quantum theory and the application of thermonuclear fission, including Planck, Szilard, Bohr, Oppenheimer, Fermi, Teller, Meitner, von Neumann, and Lawrence. From nuclear power’s earliest foreshadowing in the work of H.G. Wells to the bright glare of Trinity at Alamogordo and the arms race of the Cold War, this dread invention forever changed the course of human history, and The Making of The Atomic Bomb provides a panoramic backdrop for that story. Richard Rhodes’s ability to craft compelling biographical portraits is matched only by his rigorous scholarship. Told in rich human, political, and scientific detail that any reader can follow, The Making of the Atomic Bomb is a thought-provoking and masterful work.},

	shorttitle = {Astronomical Software Wants To Be Free},
	abstract = {Astronomical software is now a fact of daily life for all hands-on members of our community. Purpose-built software for data reduction and modeling tasks becomes ever more critical as we handle larger amounts of data and simulations. However, the writing of astronomical software is unglamorous, the rewards are not always clear, and there are structural disincentives to releasing software publicly and to embedding it in the scientific literature, which can lead to significant duplication of effort and an incomplete scientific record. We identify some of these structural disincentives and suggest a variety of approaches to address them, with the goals of raising the quality of astronomical software, improving the lot of scientist-authors, and providing benefits to the entire community, analogous to the benefits provided by open access to large survey and simulation datasets. Our aim is to open a conversation on how to move forward. We advocate that: (1) the astronomical community consider software as an integral and fundable part of facility construction and science programs; (2) that software release be considered as integral to the open and reproducible scientific process as are publication and data release; (3) that we adopt technologies and repositories for releasing and collaboration on software that have worked for open-source software; (4) that we seek structural incentives to make the release of software and related publications easier for scientist-authors; (5) that we consider new ways of funding the development of grass-roots software; (6) and that we rethink our values to acknowledge that astronomical software development is not just a technical endeavor, but a fundamental part of our scientific practice.},

	abstract = {For the safe disposal of High Level Waste ({HLW}), a common practice is to bury the sealed container called canister containing the concentrated and vitrified waste deep inside the earth surface within a rocky medium. In the event of an accidental breach of such a canister, the sealed waste may come in contact of pore water. If this happens, then the parent nuclides present in the {HLW} and their daughters generated by the radioactive decay reaction start migrating through the surrounding rock medium due to the combined effect of advection and diffusion. The accurate estimation of the transport of such a chain through a rock is important for radiological safety. Here, we report a finite difference based numerical simulation to address the issue. To simplify the problem, we consider the rock to be a collection of identical parallel fractures separated by porous matrices of equal width with a source at one end. A Forward Time and Centered Space ({FTCS}) finite difference scheme is implemented to solve the set of coupled partial differential equations that govern the transport mechanism. The scheme is validated using the methods available in the literature and subsequently it is applied to estimate the time dependent buildup of the active elements of a chain. Two independent chains each with three members are considered for simulation to address the safety related issues.},

	abstract = {Even though a computer-aided design ({CAD})-based geometry can be directly implemented in Geant4 as polygon-mesh using the G4TessellatedSolid class, the computation speed becomes very slow, especially when the geometry is composed of a large number of facets. To address this problem, in the present study, a new Geant4 solid class, named {DagSolid}, was developed based on the direct accelerated geometry for the Monte Carlo ({DAGMC}) library which provides the ray-tracing acceleration algorithm functions. To develop the {DagSolid} class, the new solid class was derived from the G4VSolid class, and its ray-tracing functions were linked to the corresponding functions of the {DAGMC} library. The results of this study show that the use of the {DagSolid} class drastically improves the computation speed. The improvement was more significant when there were more facets, meaning that the {DagSolid} class can be used more effectively for complicated geometries with many facets than for simple geometries. The maximum difference of computation speed was 1562 and 680 times for Geantino and {ChargedGeantino}, respectively. For real particles (gammas, electrons, neutrons, and protons), the difference of computation speed was less significant, but still was within the range of 53–685 times depending on the type of beam particles simulated.},

	abstract = {Modeling and simulations are naturally augmented by extensive Uncertainty Quantification ({UQ}) and sensitivity analysis requirements in the nuclear reactor system design, in which uncertainties must be quantified in order to prove that the investigated design stays within acceptance criteria. Historically, expert judgment has been used to specify the nominal values, probability density functions and upper and lower bounds of the simulation code random input parameters for the forward {UQ} process. The purpose of this paper is to replace such ad-hoc expert judgment of the statistical properties of input model parameters with inverse {UQ} process. Inverse {UQ} seeks statistical descriptions of the model random input parameters that are consistent with the experimental data. Bayesian analysis is used to establish the inverse {UQ} problems based on experimental data, with systematic and rigorously derived surrogate models based on Polynomial Chaos Expansion ({PCE}).

The methods developed here are demonstrated with the Point Reactor Kinetics Equation ({PRKE}) coupled with lumped parameter thermal-hydraulics feedback model. Three input parameters, external reactivity, Doppler reactivity coefficient and coolant temperature coefficient are modeled as uncertain input parameters. Their uncertainties are inversely quantified based on synthetic experimental data. Compared with the direct numerical simulation, surrogate model by {PC} expansion shows high efficiency and accuracy. In addition, inverse {UQ} with Bayesian analysis can calibrate the random input parameters such that the simulation results are in a better agreement with the experimental data.},

Inside the Collaborative Project on the European Sodium Fast Reactor, several accidental scenario have been studied. Nevertheless, none of them coped with mechanical safety assessment of the fuel cladding under accidental conditions. Among the accidental conditions considered, there is the unprotected transient of overpower ({UTOP}), due to the insertion, at the end of the first fuel cycle, of a positive reactivity into the reactor core as a consequence of the unexpected runaway of one control rod. The goal of the study was the search for a detailed distribution of the fission power, in the radial and axial directions, within the power peaked fuel pin under the above accidental conditions. Results show that after the control rod ejection an increase from 658 W/cm3 to 894 W/cm3, i.e. of some 36\%, is expected for the power peaked fuel pin. This information will represent the base to investigate, in a future work, the fuel cladding safety margin.},

	abstract = {Time series models are often constructed by combining nonstationary effects such as trends with stochastic processes that are believed to be stationary. Although stationarity of the underlying process is typically crucial to ensure desirable properties or even validity of statistical estimators, there are numerous time series models for which this stationarity is not yet proven. A major barrier is that the most commonly-used methods assume φ-irreducibility, a condition that can be violated for the important class of discrete-valued observation-driven models. We show (strict) stationarity for the class of Generalized Autoregressive Moving Average ({GARMA}) models, which provides a flexible analogue of {ARMA} models for count, binary, or other discrete-valued data. We do this from two perspectives. First, we show conditions under which {GARMA} models have a unique stationary distribution (so are strictly stationary when initialized in that distribution). This result potentially forms the foundation for broadly showing consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimators for {GARMA} models. Since these conclusions are not immediate, however, we also take a second approach. We show stationarity and ergodicity of a perturbed version of the {GARMA} model, which utilizes the fact that the perturbed model is φ-irreducible and immediately implies consistent estimation of the mean, lagged covariances, and other functionals of the perturbed process. We relate the perturbed and original processes by showing that the perturbed model yields parameter estimates that are arbitrarily close to those of the original model.},

Although it is the country with the largest number of commercial nuclear electric power plants, as of this writing the United States had no program in progress to dispose of the nuclear fuel discharges it had already accumulated. The impediments to progress in this area are primarily political rather than technical. The Nordic Countries Sweden and Finland have both decided on sites for excavated repositories in granite. The U.S. Department of Energy has submitted a site license application for a repository excavated in volcanic tuff. An analysis from Sandia National Laboratory has suggests that a deep borehole repository is feasible that would exceed U.S. regulatory standards on migration of radioactive materials into groundwater by over a billion fold. As of early 2015, the U.S. Administration, the U.S. Congress, and the State of Nevada were nevertheless at an impasse on how to dispose of only part of the fuel that had already been discharged from commercial nuclear reactors.},

	abstract = {Dear Mr. Bae,
 
Attached, please find a zipped file containing the Form {GC}-859 Nuclear Fuel Data file.  All data are as of June 30, 2013 and represent data collected by {EIA} on the Form {GC}-859 survey.  These are the most recent data available.  The data file is in Microsoft Access format and has the file name of “{GC}859\_Distribution.accdb.”  Data that were designated by respondents as “proprietary” are not included.
The zipped file also contains a copy of the Form {GC}-859 Nuclear Fuel Data Survey with supplemental tables and instructions (file: Form {GC}859 Survey.doc) and a description of the Form {GC}-859 Nuclear Fuel Data file (file: {DataFileDescriptionGC}859\_DistCopy.doc).
Note that respondents were not required to report assemblies that had been shipped to away-from-reactor (off-site) facilities.  Previous surveys ({RW}-859) reflected all commercial spent nuclear fuel discharges, including assemblies that had been shipped to federal facilities.  Therefore, data previously reported may not be included in the attached file.
In order to view the database, the Microsoft Access format requires users’ computers to be registered for the component {OfficeViewer}.ocx.  Because the database is only tables, users will most likely see the error message “Your Microsoft Access database or project contains a missing or broken reference to the file ‘officeviewer.ocx’ version 8.0.”  Users must click “{OK}” several times before the error message disappears.  No data are harmed during this process and the database may be used fully after this process is complete.
The specific data you requested (names of each power plant and their spent fuel inventory) are in Tables {AppendixC} and C1.
Should you have any questions or require additional information, please contact Marta.Gospodarczyk@eia.gov (202-586-0527) or Nick Domenico at Nicholas.Domenico@eia.gov (202-586-4405).
Please confirm a receipt of this email and attached file.

	abstract = {Nuclear power is producing electricity for the benefit of society but is also leaving radioactive residues behind. It is our responsibility to handle these residues in a safe and proper manner. The development of a system for handling spent fuel from nuclear power plants has proceeded in steps. The same is true for the actual construction of facilities and will continue to be the case for the final repository for spent fuel and other types of long-lived wastes. The primary objective in constructing the repository will be to isolate and contain the radioactive waste. In case the isolation fails for some reason the multibarrier system should retain and retard the radionuclides that might come into contact with the groundwater. A repository is now planned to be built in two steps where the first step will include deposition of about 400 canisters with spent fuel. This first step should be finished in about 20 years from now and be followed by an extensive evaluation of the results from not only this particular step but also from the development of alternative routes before deciding on how to proceed. A special facility to encapsulate the spent fuel is also required. Such an encapsulation plant is proposed to be constructed as an extension of the existing interim storage {CLAB}. Finding a site for the repository is a critical issue in the implementation of any repository. The siting process started a few years ago and made some progress but is by no means yet completed. It will go on at least into the early part of the next decade. When the present nuclear power plants begin to be due for retirement there should also be some facilities in place to take permanent care of the long-lived radioactive residues. Progress in siting will be a prerequisite for success in our responsibility to make progress towards a safe permanent solution of the waste issue.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study examines the effects of the risk from transporting high–level radioactive waste to the proposed Yucca Mountain repository on housing location decisions in Southern Nevada. Using data from a survey of southern Nevada households, we develop a model–based subjective risk estimate for each household. We then explore different factors that may influence the household's location decisions if the proposed transportation route is ultimately chosen for nuclear waste transport. We extend the conventional expected utility model to allow for uncertainty surrounding the actual risks borne by the household. Finally, we examine the impact of federal government compensation on households’ location decisions. The findings indicate that residents currently living near the proposed transportation route express subjective risk estimates much larger than those reported by the Department of Energy. In general, households that are uncertain about the future risks are more likely to relocate than those expressing certainty. When everything is considered, the model predicts that between one and three percent of households living near the transportation route are likely to relocate. Compensation can influence some households to remain at their present location and bear the transport risk.},

The analysis was performed in the context of a U.S. Department of Energy effort to develop a compendium of informative nuclear fuel cycle performance data. The objective of this paper is to determine whether intermediate spectrum systems, having a majority of fission events occurring with incident neutron energies between 1 {eV} and 105 {eV}, perform as well as fast spectrum systems in this fuel cycle. The intermediate spectrum options analyzed include tight lattice heavy or light water-cooled reactors, continuously refueled molten salt reactors, and a sodium-cooled reactor with hydride fuel. All options were modeled in reactor physics codes to calculate their lattice physics, spectrum characteristics, and fuel compositions over time. Based on these results, detailed metrics were calculated to compare the fuel cycle performance. These metrics include waste management and resource utilization, and are binned to accommodate uncertainties. The performance of the intermediate systems for this self-sustaining thorium fuel cycle was similar to a representative fast spectrum system. However, the number of fission neutrons emitted per neutron absorbed limits performance in intermediate spectrum systems.},

In key scientific areas of great societal importance, models and the software that implement them define both how science is done and what science is done (4, 5). Across all science, this dependence has led to concerns around the need for open access to software (6, 7), centered on the reproducibility of research (1, 8–10). From fields such as high-performance computing, we learn key insights and best practices for how to develop, standardize, and implement software (11). Open and systematic approaches to the development of software are essential for all sciences. But for many scientists this is not sufficient. We describe problems with the adoption and use of scientific software.},

	abstract = {The {MonALISA} (Monitoring Agents using a Large Integrated Services Architecture) framework provides a distributed service system capable of controlling and optimizing large-scale, data-intensive applications. An essential part of managing large-scale, distributed data-processing facilities is a monitoring system for computing facilities, storage, networks, and the very large number of applications running on these systems in near realtime. All this monitoring information gathered for all the subsystems is essential for developing the required higher-level services—the components that provide decision support and some degree of automated decisions—and for maintaining and optimizing workflow in large-scale distributed systems. These management and global optimization functions are performed by higher-level agent-based services. We present several applications of {MonALISA}'s higher-level services including optimized dynamic routing, control, data-transfer scheduling, distributed job scheduling, dynamic allocation of storage resource to running jobs and automated management of remote services among a large set of grid facilities.},

	shorttitle = {How Do Astronomers Share Data?},
	abstract = {We analyze data sharing practices of astronomers over the past fifteen years. An analysis of {URL} links embedded in papers published by the American Astronomical Society reveals that the total number of links included in the literature rose dramatically from 1997 until 2005, when it leveled off at around 1500 per year. The analysis also shows that the availability of linked material decays with time: in 2011, 44\% of links published a decade earlier, in 2001, were broken. A rough analysis of link types reveals that links to data hosted on astronomers' personal websites become unreachable much faster than links to datasets on curated institutional sites. To gauge astronomers' current data sharing practices and preferences further, we performed in-depth interviews with 12 scientists and online surveys with 173 scientists, all at a large astrophysical research institute in the United States: the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, in Cambridge, {MA}. Both the in-depth interviews and the online survey indicate that, in principle, there is no philosophical objection to data-sharing among astronomers at this institution. Key reasons that more data are not presently shared more efficiently in astronomy include: the difficulty of sharing large data sets; over reliance on non-robust, non-reproducible mechanisms for sharing data (e.g. emailing it); unfamiliarity with options that make data-sharing easier (faster) and/or more robust; and, lastly, a sense that other researchers would not want the data to be shared. We conclude with a short discussion of a new effort to implement an easy-to-use, robust, system for data sharing in astronomy, at theastrodata.org, and we analyze the uptake of that system to-date.},

This is particularly the case for parallel computing, which is in a total state of flux, and where experiments are necessary to substantiate, complement, and challenge theoretical modeling and analysis. Here, experimental work is as important as are advances in theory, that are indeed often driven by the experimental findings. In parallel computing, scientific contributions presented in research articles are therefore often based on experimental data, with a substantial part devoted to presenting and discussing the experimental findings. As in all of experimental science, experiments must be presented in a way that makes reproduction by other researchers possible, in principle. Despite appearance to the contrary, we contend that reproducibility plays a small role, and is typically not achieved. As can be found, articles often do not have a sufficiently detailed description of their experiments, and do not make available the software used to obtain the claimed results. As a consequence, parallel computational results are most often impossible to reproduce, often questionable, and therefore of little or no scientific value. We believe that the description of how to reproduce findings should play an important part in every serious, experiment-based parallel computing research article. We aim to initiate a discussion of the reproducibility issue in parallel computing, and elaborate on the importance of reproducible research for (1) better and sounder technical/scientific papers, (2) a sounder and more efficient review process and (3) more effective collective work. This paper expresses our current view on the subject and should be read as a position statement for discussion and future work. We do not consider the related (but no less important) issue of the quality of the experimental design.},

Before this research project was initiated, no adequate experimental data existed for reactivity initiated transients that could be used to assess coupled three-dimensional (3D) kinetics and 3D T/H codes which have been, or are being developed around the world. Using various Test Reactor Isotope General Atomic ({TRIGA}) reactor core configurations at the Penn State Breazeale Reactor ({PSBR}), it is possible to determine the level of neutronics modeling required to describe kinetics and T/H feedback interactions. This research demonstrates that the small compact {PSBR} {TRIGA} core does not necessarily behave as a point kinetics reactor, but that this {TRIGA} can provide actual test results for 3D kinetics code benchmark efforts. This research focused on developing in-reactor tests that exhibited 3D neutronics effects coupled with 3D T/H feedback. A variety of pulses were used to evaluate the level of kinetics modeling needed for prompt temperature feedback in the fuel. Ramps and square waves were used to evaluate the detail of modeling needed for the delayed T/H feedback of the coolant. A stepped ramp was performed to evaluate and verify the derived thermal constants for the specific {PSBR} {TRIGA} core loading pattern. As part of the analytical benchmark research, the {STAR} 3D kinetics code (Weader, 1992, {STAR}: Space and time analysis of reactors, Version 5, Level 3, Users Guide, Yankee Atomic Electric Company, {YEAC} 1758, Bolton, {MA}) was used to model the transient experiments. The {STAR} models were coupled with the one-dimensional (1D) {WIGL} and {LRA} and 3D {COBRA} (Rowe, 1973, {COBRA} {IIIC}: A digital computer program for steady-state and transient thermal-hydraulic analysis of rod bundle nuclear fuel elements, Battelle Institute, Richland, {WA}). T/H models to determine the level of T/H modeling required to accurately describe the behaviour of the {PSBR} {TRIGA} core during these transient conditions. {STAR}'s 1D T/H models ({WIGL} and {LRA}) were adequate for the rapid pulse events, when accurate temperature-dependent fuel thermal constants were used and the reactor coolant feedback mechanism was small. However, the longer transients (i.e. ramps, square waves) necessitated the use of the {COBRA} 3D fluid flow analysis coupled with the 3D {STAR} kinetics model.},

The analyses were performed by a coupled kinetic–thermal–hydraulic computer code developed specifically for this task. The 10-{MW} {IAEA} {MTR} research reactor was subjected to unprotected reactivity insertion (step and ramp) for both low and high-enriched fuel with continuous reactivity feedback due to coolant and fuel temperature effects. In general, it was found that the power, core mass flow rate and clad temperature under fully established natural circulation are higher for high-enriched fuel than for low enriched fuel. This is unlike the case of decay heat removal, where equal clad temperatures are reported for both fuels. The analysis of reactivity represented by the maximum insertion of positive reactivity (\$0.73) demonstrated the high inherent safety features of {MTR}-type research reactor. Even in the case of total excess reactivity without scram, the high reactivity feedbacks of fuel and moderator temperatures limit the power excursion and avoid consequently escalation of clad temperature to the level of onset of nucleate boiling and sub-cooled void formation. The code can also be modified to provide an accurate capability for the analyses of research reactor transients under forced convection.},

	abstract = {Properties of the two-phase hydride U0.3ZrH1.6 pertinent to performance as a nuclear fuel for {LWRs} are reviewed. Much of the available data come from the Space Nuclear Auxiliary Power ({SNAP}) program of 4 decades ago and from the more restricted data base prepared for the {TRIGA} research reactors some 3 decades back. Transport, mechanical, thermal and chemical properties are summarized. A principal difference between oxide and hydride fuels is the high thermal conductivity of the latter. This feature greatly decreases the temperature drop over the fuel during operation, thereby reducing the release of fission gases to the fraction due only to recoil. However, very unusual early swelling due to void formation around the uranium particles has been observed in hydride fuels. Avoidance of this source of swelling limits the maximum fuel temperature to ∼650 °C (the design limit recommended by the fuel developer is 750 °C). To satisfy this temperature limitation, the fuel-cladding gap needs to be bonded with a liquid metal instead of helium. Because the former has a thermal conductivity ∼100 times larger than the latter, there is no restriction on gap thickness as there is in helium-bonded fuel rods. This opens the possibility of initial gap sizes large enough to significantly delay the onset of pellet-cladding mechanical interaction ({PCMI}). The large fission-product swelling rate of hydride fuel (3× that of oxide fuel) requires an initial radial fuel-cladding gap of ∼300 m if {PCMI} is to be avoided. The liquid-metal bond permits operation of the fuel at current {LWR} linear-heat-generation rates without exceeding any design constraint. The behavior of hydrogen in the fuel is the source of phenomena during operation that are absent in oxide fuels. Because of the large heat of transport (thermal diffusivity) of H in {ZrHx}, redistribution of hydrogen in the temperature gradient in the fuel pellet changes the initial H/Zr ratio of 1.6 to ∼1.45 at the center and ∼1.70 at the periphery. Because the density of the hydride decreases with increasing H/Zr ratio, the result of H redistribution is to subject the interior of the pellet to a tensile stress while the outside of the pellet is placed in compression. The resulting stress at the pellet periphery is sufficient to overcome the tensile stress due to thermal expansion in the temperature gradient and to prevent radial cracking that is a characteristic of oxide fuel. Several mechanisms for reduction of the H/Zr ratio during irradiation are identified. The first is transfer of impurity oxygen in the fuel from Zr to rare-earth oxide fission products. The second is the formation of metal hydrides by these same fission products. The third is by loss to the plenum as H2.

The review of the fabrication method for the hydride fuel suggests that its production, even on a large scale, may be significantly higher than the cost of oxide fuel fabrication.},

The aim of the current work is an attempt to apply this technique using the system thermal-hydraulic {RELAP}5/Mod3.2 code. For this purpose, the {IAEA} 10 {MW} {MTR} pool type research reactors Benchmark problem is considered. The exercise consists in performing some fast transients related to typical reactivity induced accidents, and relatively slow transients related to loss of flow accidents. The {RELAP}5 results were compared against previous data obtained by various conservative channel codes. Differences between the two modeling approaches are afterwards emphasized and discussed.},

The core excess of reactivity obtained was 1.99 \$, and the shutdown margin was 1.33 \$. The reactivity needed to operate the {IPR}-R1 reactor at 100 {kW} was 0.72 \$, mainly due to the prompt negative temperature coefficient. A significant amount of reactivity is needed to overcome temperature and allow the reactor to operate at the higher power levels. The loss of reactivity due to xenon poisoning after 8 h of operation at 100 {kW} was around 0.20 \$, and the highest reactivity loss value caused by a void inserted in the central thimble was 0.22 \$. From the results obtained, it was possible to balance all the determined reactivity losses with the reactivity excess available in the reactor, considering the present and the future reactor power operation.},

	doi = {http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1134652},
	abstract = {The {CYCLUS} Fuel Cycle Simulator is a framework for assessment of nuclear fuel cycle options. While {CYCLUS} has previously simulated system transitions from the current fuel cycle strategy to a future option, those tran- sitions have never previously been driven by market forces in the simulation. This work includes the first draft of a set of libraries that have been contibuted to the {CYCLUS} framework to enable a market-driven transition analysis.
The {CYCLUS} simulation framework is incomplete without a suite of dynamically loadable libraries representing the process physics of the nuclear fuel cycle (i.e. mining, fuel fabrication, chemical processing, transmutation, reprocessing, etc.). Within Cycamore, the additional modules repository within the {CYCLUS} ecosystem, provides some basic li- braries to represent these processes. However, extension of {CYCLUS} with new capabilities is community-driven, relying on contributions by user-developers. The libraries contributed in this work are examples of such contributions.
This work relies heavily on the {CycStub} repository which included contributions from myself, Kathryn Huff, as well as Matthew Gidden, Anthony Scopatz, Robert Carlsen, Paul Wilson, and Olzhas Rahkimov at the University of Wisconsin - Madison within the Computational Nuclear Engineering Research Group ({CNERG}).},

This paper presents a range of potential United Kingdom ({UK}) specific nuclear fuel cycle options for current, near, medium and long-term deployment that have been evaluated using these analysis tools and capabilities. These fuel cycles illustrate how the {UK} could utilize the plutonium stockpile and highlights some of the key issues for {UK} new nuclear build scenarios in the near, medium and long term.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a new fuel cycle benchmarking analysis methodology by coupling Gaussian process regression, a popular technique in Machine Learning, to dynamic time warping, a mechanism widely used in speech recognition. Together they generate figures-of-merit that are applicable to any time series metric that a benchmark may study. The figures-of-merit account for uncertainty in the metric itself, utilize information across the whole time domain, and do not require that the simulators use a common time grid. Here, a distance measure is defined that can be used to compare the performance of each simulator for a given metric. Additionally, a contribution measure is derived from the distance measure that can be used to rank order the importance of fuel cycle metrics. Lastly, this paper warns against using standard signal processing techniques for error reduction. This is because it is found that error reduction is better handled by the Gaussian process regression itself.},

	abstract = {Waste management has developed in many countries and will continue to do so. Changes towards increased recovery of resources in order to meet climate targets and for society to transition to a circular economy are important driving forces. Scenarios are important tools for planning and assessing possible future developments and policies. This paper presents a comprehensive life cycle assessment ({LCA}) model for environmental assessments of scenarios and waste management policy instruments. It is unique by including almost all waste flows in a country and also allow for including waste prevention. The results show that the environmental impacts from future waste management scenarios in Sweden can differ a lot. Waste management will continue to contribute with environmental benefits, but less so in the more sustainable future scenarios, since the surrounding energy and transportation systems will be less polluting and also because less waste will be produced. Valuation results indicate that climate change, human toxicity and resource depletion are the most important environmental impact categories for the Swedish waste management system. Emissions of fossil {CO}2 from waste incineration will continue to be a major source of environmental impacts in these scenarios. The model is used for analyzing environmental impacts of several policy instruments including weight based collection fee, incineration tax, a resource tax and inclusion of waste in a green electricity certification system. The effect of the studied policy instruments in isolation are in most cases limited, suggesting that stronger policy instruments as well as combinations are necessary to reach policy goals as set out in for example the {EU} action plan on circular economy.},

	abstract = {The release of fission products from coated particle fuel to primary coolant, as well as the activation of coolant and impurities, were analysed for a fluoride salt-cooled high-temperature reactor ({FHR}) system, and the activity of radionuclides accumulated in the coolant during normal operation was calculated. The release rate (release fraction per unit time) of fission products was calculated with {STACY} code, which is modelled mainly based on the Fick’s law, while the activation of coolant and impurities was calculated with {SCALE} code. The accumulation of radionuclides in the coolant has been calculated with a simplified model, which is generally a time integration considering the generation and decay of radionuclides. The results show that activation products are the dominant gamma source in the primary coolant system during normal operation of the {FHR} while fission products become the dominant source after shutdown. In operation condition, health-impacts related nuclides such as 3H, and 14C originate from the activation of lithium and coolant impurities including carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. According to the calculated effective cross sections of neutron activation, 6Li and 14N are the dominant 3H production source and 14C production source, respectively. Considering the high production rate, 3H and 14C should be treated before being released to the environment.},

and static reactor analysis, computation starts at
an initial guess of source distribution and iterates
a cycle of the particle transport tracking and
population normalization. In preliminary
(inactive) cycles the source distribution is
converging to the fluctuation range of
stationarity. The subsequent cycles are called
active cycles where effective neutron
multiplication factor, interaction rate
distributions, etc., are computed. The present
work concerns an “on-the-fly” source
convergence diagnosis. At Step 1, a smaller
number of cycles preceding the current cycle are
used for the diagnosis and, once Step 1 criterion
is satisfied, the number of preceding cycles to be
used at Step 2 is increased and the checking of
Step 2 criterion is made at the cycle the increased
number of preceding cycles after the beginning
of Step 2. The process of increasing the number
of preceding cycles continues through Step 10.
These steps will improve previous on-the-fly
type diagnostics [1, 2] and are analogous to a
natural human quest; approach a solution by a
crude method and then refine the method.},

It is found that, unlike the equity markets, the appreciation and depreciation shocks of the yen against the dollar have similar effects on future volatilities. Although the results reject both the stable and the integrated models, our analysis of the response coefficients of the past shocks and the application of the models to the estimation of the capital requirements for trading the currencies show that there are no substantial differences between the fractionally integrated models and the stable models.},

To generalize this implausible assumption, a new class of stochastic processes called autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic ({ARCH}) processes are introduced in this paper. These are mean zero, serially uncorrelated processes with nonconstant variances conditional on the past, but constant unconditional variances. For such processes, the recent past gives information about the one-period forecast variance. A regression model is then introduced with disturbances following an {ARCH} process. Maximum likelihood estimators are described and a simple scoring iteration formulated. Ordinary least squares maintains its optimality properties in this set-up, but maximum likelihood is more efficient. The relative efficiency is calculated and can be infinite. To test whether the disturbances follow an {ARCH} process, the Lagrange multiplier procedure is employed. The test is based simply on the autocorrelation of the squared {OLS} residuals. This model is used to estimate the means and variances of inflation in the U.K. The {ARCH} effect is found to be significant and the estimated variances increase substantially during the chaotic seventies.},

	abstract = {Simulation of the nuclear fuel cycle can be performed using a wide range of techniques and methodologies. Past efforts have focused on specific fuel cycles or reactor technologies. The {CYCLUS} fuel cycle simulator seeks to separate the design of the simulation from the fuel cycle or technologies of interest. In order to support this separation, a robust supply–demand communication and solution framework is required. Accordingly an agent-based supply-chain framework, the Dynamic Resource Exchange ({DRE}), has been designed implemented in {CYCLUS}. It supports the communication of complex resources, namely isotopic compositions of nuclear fuel, between fuel cycle facilities and their managers (e.g., institutions and regions). Instances of supply and demand are defined as an optimization problem and solved for each timestep. Importantly, the {DRE} allows each agent in the simulation to independently indicate preference for specific trading options in order to meet both physics requirements and satisfy constraints imposed by potential socio-political models. To display the variety of possible simulations that the {DRE} enables, example scenarios are formulated and described. Important features include key fuel-cycle facility outages, introduction of external recycled fuel sources (similar to the current mixed oxide ({MOX}) fuel fabrication facility in the United States), and nontrivial interactions between fuel cycles existing in different regions.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the random arrangement effect of coated fuel particles ({CFPs}) on the criticality of the fuel compact of the high-temperature engineering test reactor ({HTTR}). A utility program coupled with {MCNP}6, namely the realized random packing ({RRP}) model, was developed to explicitly model the random arrangement of {CFPs} in a specified fuel compact of the {HTTR}. The criticality and neutronic calculations for a pin cell model were performed using the Monte Carlo {MCNP}6 code with {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 neutron library data. The reliability of the {RRP} model was confirmed by the insignificant variance of the infinite multiplication factor (kinf) among 10 different random arrangements of the {CFPs}. Next, the criticality of the {RRP} model was compared with those of a non-truncated uniform packing ({NUP}) model and an on-the-fly random packing ({ORP}) model, which is a stochastic geometry capability in {MCNP}6. The results indicated that there was no substantial difference between the {NUP} and {ORP} models. However, the {RRP} model presented a lower kinf (by about 0.32–0.52\%Δk/k) than the {NUP} model. In addition, the difference in kinf was increased as uranium enrichment decreased. Investigation of the 4-factor formula showed that the difference in kinf was predominantly a result of the resonance escape probability, with the {RRP} model showing the smallest value.},

The concepts of multi-objective optimization and Pareto optimality are introduced in the beginning, and a comparison with the deterministic optimization algorithms is performed stressing out the pros and the cons of these different approaches to optimization. Several algorithms for stochastic optimization are presented such as particle swarm optimization, game theory optimization, evolutionary and genetic algorithms. Some guidelines on how to choose the most suitable stochastic optimization algorithm depending on the problem to be addressed are given in the end.},

The chapter is further subdivided into two major sections: unconstrained and constrained optimization. In the first several optimization methods are introduced such as simplex, Newton and quasi-Newton, conjugate directions, and Levenberg–Marquardt. In the latter, due to the complexity of the topic only a brief discussion on the main aspects and approaches found in constrained optimization algorithms is given. These are elimination methods, Lagrangian methods, active set methods, 0s methods. Sequential quadratic programming and mixed integer programming are also introduced. In the conclusions, the different algorithms are discussed in terms of their simplicity, reliability, and efficiency.},

	abstract = {The {MSR} (Molten Salt Reactor) is one of the six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors envisaged by the {GIF}-{IV} (Generation {IV} International Forum) initiative for the long term evolution of the nuclear technology, in the direction of a more sustainable, safe, proliferation resistant, and economic power generation. The {MSR} is characterised by a complex and highly non-linear behaviour, which requires a careful investigation, as a consequence of some unusual features like the presence of a fluid fuel and the drift of delayed neutron precursors ({DNP}) along the primary circuit. In this paper, the {MSR} primary circuit dynamics is analysed with reference to the {MSRE} (Molten Salt Reactor Experiment), due to the availability of both a detailed design and experimental data. Numerical models featured by increasing complexity are presented. In particular, a zero-dimensional model is developed, and two other models introducing a one-dimensional discretization for the {DNP} drift and/or the heat convection are also elaborated. These simplified models are then compared with a more complex model, obtained according to an innovative Multi-Physics Modelling ({MPM}) approach to the dynamic analysis, where the partial differential equations governing the different phenomena in a core channel are solved in a two-dimensional domain, within the same computational environment. A one-dimensional closure of the primary circuit is also provided. The {MPM} approach gives a unique insight into the influence of local effects on the overall dynamic behaviour of the reactor, while the variety of developed models allows a systematic investigation about the dimensional effects in the modelling of {MSRs}. This work represents a starting point in the set-up of a Multi-Physics ({MP}) simulation tool, suitable for calculations with different degrees of accuracy and physical complexity, and paves the way towards the development of {MP} models capable of a point-by-point coupling of all the phenomena characterising the {MSRs}, and the nuclear reactors in general.},

This nuclear simulation chain has to be able to simulate and assess all relevant physical processes and phenomena for all operating states and (severe) accidents. In the present contribution, the nuclear simulation chain developed and applied by {GRS} as well as selected examples of its application are presented. The latter demonstrate impressively the width of its scope and its performance. The {GRS} codes can be passed on request to other (national as well as international) organizations. This contributes to a worldwide increase of the nuclear safety standards. The code transfer is especially important for developing and emerging countries lacking the financial means and/or the necessary know-how for this purpose.

	abstract = {Monte Carlo simulations provide an indispensible model for solving radiative transport problems, but their slow convergence inhibits their use as an everyday computational tool. In this paper, we present two new ideas for accelerating the convergence of Monte Carlo algorithms based upon an efficient algorithm that couples simulations of forward and adjoint transport equations. Forward random walks are first processed in stages, each using a fixed sample size, and information from stage k is used to alter the sampling and weighting procedure in stage k + 1 . This produces rapid geometric convergence and accounts for dramatic gains in the efficiency of the forward computation. In case still greater accuracy is required in the forward solution, information from an adjoint simulation can be added to extend the geometric learning of the forward solution. The resulting new approach should find widespread use when fast, accurate simulations of the transport equation are needed.},

	abstract = {The background of the Midway forward–adjoint coupling method including the black absorber technique for efficient Monte Carlo determination of radiation detector responses is described. The method is implemented in the general purpose {MCNP} Monte Carlo code. The utilization of the method is fairly straightforward and does not require any substantial extra expertise. The method was applied to a standard neutron well logging porosity tool problem. The results exhibit reliability and high efficiency of the Midway method. For the studied problem the efficiency gain is considerably higher than for a normal forward calculation, which is already strongly optimized by weight-windows. No additional effort is required to adjust the Midway model if the position of the detector or the porosity of the formation is changed. Additionally, the Midway method can be used with other variance reduction techniques if extra gain in efficiency is desired.},

Comparisons were made between the benchmark eigenvalues and those output by the Shift code. In addition, mesh-based scalar flux tally results generated by Shift were compared to those obtained using {MCNP}5 on an identical model and tally grid. The Shift-generated eigenvalues were within three standard deviations of the benchmark and {MCNP}5-1.60 values in all cases. The flux tallies generated by Shift were found to be in very good agreement with those from {MCNP}.},

of burn-up credit has gained in world-wide interest during the last 20 years and it represents one
of the most technically challenging issues in nuclear criticality safety. To address these challenges
and help co-ordinate activities in {NEA} member countries, the Working Party on Nuclear
Criticality Safety ({WPNCS}) of the {OECD}/{NEA} Nuclear Science Committee ({NSC}) has organised the
Expert Group on Burn-up Credit Criticality ({EGBUC}). The decision of many countries to advance
burn-up credit as part of their criticality safety licensing strategy has heightened interest in
measurement data needed to validate code calculations for a burn-up credit methodology.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of the Generation {IV} Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor ({SFR}) R\&amp;D program of {CEA} (French Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique et aux Energies Alternatives), reactor behavior in case of severe accidents is assessed. Such accidents are usually simulated with mechanistic calculation tools (such as {SAS} and {SIMMER}). As a complement to these codes, which give reference accidental transient, a new physico-statistical approach is currently followed by {CEA}; its final objective being to derive the variability of the main results of interest for the safety. This approach involves a fast-running description of extended accident sequences coupling physical models for the main phenomena with advanced statistical analysis techniques. It enables to perform a large number of simulations in a reasonable computational time and to describe all the possible bifurcations of the accident transient.
In this context, this paper presents a physical tool (models and results assessment) dedicated to the beginning of the primary phase of an Unprotected Loss Of Flow accident (i.e. before the first pin degradation). This study focuses on the sodium thermalhydraulic behavior during this phase, because according to some previous boiling tests, a stabilized boiling flow could be achieved at the top of some subassemblies, thus preventing pins complete dry-out and consequent core degradation. Experiments that demonstrated this possible boiling stabilization were carried out at constant power. However, in case of an unprotected accident, power will vary according to reactivity feed-back effects.
This physical tool is described before presenting the comparison of its results with experimental tests results (static and dynamic aspects) for the thermalhydraulic behavior and with mechanistic {SIMMER} code results for the global core evolution (including neutronics) during an {ULOF} transient. Moreover, the flow evolutions obtained with this tool are demonstrated to be in good agreement with the Ledinegg’s quasi-static theory regarding boiling stabilization possibilities or flow excursion. This tool is demonstrated to be capable of reproducing the magnitude of mass-flow rate, reactivity, power evolution during an {ULOF} with a discrepancy of less than 3 \% regarding the same transient simulated with {SIMMER}. It will be used for safety-informed design and stability analyses of fast reactor systems, allowing to emphasize main dominant phenomena and significant trends for safety assessment. In the future, this physical tool, associated to statistical treatments of the effect of uncertainties, will enable large sensitivity analysis studies.},

	abstract = {The generation of multigroup neutron cross-section libraries is a key issue of the multigroup transport calculations in reactor physics. The correct choice of the boundaries of the energy groups, in particular, is decisive for obtaining reliable results. Knowledge of the reactor physics, general and specific of the studied reactor, along with long and refined analyses are required for finding out a reasonable energy structure, which is specific for the considered reactor and might be unsuitable for other systems. The genetic algorithm presented in this work aims to choose the most appropriate energy structure for the considered system to collapse a fine multigroup library into a few-groups one, usable for transient transport calculations. The user is free to choose the number of energy groups of the final library, which is in direct relation with the precision required and the time available for the simulation. The methodology is coupled with {SIMMER}-{III} code and applied to 3 reactor systems: {ESNII}+ {ASTRID}, {ESFR} and {MSFR}. The results show that the algorithm can find representative energy structures, providing accurate results on the multiplication factor. The results of each test are analyzed, showing how different compositions, geometries and neutron spectra guide the algorithm choices, so demonstrating the effectiveness of the method.},

	url = {http://www.gao.gov/assets/670/666454.pdf},
	abstract = {Why {GAO} Did This Study 
{DOE} is responsible for disposing of commercial spent nuclear fuel. {DOE}
entered into contracts with owners and generators of spent nuclear fuel to
begin disposing of it beginning in 1998, with plans for disposal in a national repository. {DOE}, however, was unable to meet the 1998 date and, as a result of lawsuits, the federal government has paid out about \$3.7 billion for storage costs. {DOE} proposed a new strategy in January 2013 to build consolidated interim storage facilities—starting operations in 2021 and 2025. {GAO} was asked to review issues related to {DOE}’s strategy for managing spent nuclear fuel. This report (1) describes the expected rate of spent nuclear fuel accumulation in wet and dry storage, (2) identifies the basis of federal liability for spent nuclear fuel management to date and of {DOE}’s estimate of future liabilities, and (3) assesses challenges, if any, that
experts and stakeholders have identified to the federal government’s
ability to meet {DOE}’s time frames for managing spent nuclear fuel at
consolidated interim storage facilities and potential ways for {DOE} to mitigate the challenges. {GAO} reviewed documents from {DOE} and other
agencies, and interviewed experts and stakeholders from industry, federal and state governments, interest groups, and independent entities.

What {GAO} Recommends
{DOE} should implement a coordinated outreach strategy to better inform the public about federal spent nuclear fuel management issues. {DOE} generally agreed with the findings and recommendation in the report.},

	abstract = {Small modular reactors ({SMRs}) may offer potential benefits relative to large light water reactors, such as enhanced flexibility in deployment and operation. However, it is vital to understand the holistic impact of {SMRs} on nuclear fuel cycle performance. The focus of this paper is the fuel cycle impacts of light water {SMRs} in a once-through fuel cycle with low-enriched uranium fuel. A key objective of this paper is to describe preliminary neutronics and fuel cycle analyses conducted in support of the {US} Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Fuel Cycle Options Campaign. The hypothetical light water {SMR} example case considered in these preliminary scoping studies is a “cartridge type” one-batch core with slightly less than 5.0\% enrichment.
The high-level issues identified and preliminary scoping calculations in this paper are intended to inform decision makers regarding potential fuel cycle impacts of one-batch thermal-spectrum {SMRs}. In particular, this paper highlights the impact of increased neutron leakage and a reduced number of batches on the achievable burnup of the reactor. Fuel cycle performance metrics for the simplified example {SMR} analyzed herein are compared with those for a conventional three-batch light water reactor ({LWR}) in the following areas: nuclear waste management, environmental impact, and resource utilization. The metrics performance for such an {SMR} is degraded for the mass of spent nuclear fuel and high-level waste disposed of per energy generated, mass of depleted uranium disposed of per energy generated, land use per energy generated, and carbon emissions per energy generated.
Finally, it is noted that the features of some {SMR} designs impact three main aspects of fuel cycle performance: (1) small cores, which mean high leakage (there is a radial and an axial component); (2) a heterogeneous core and extensive use of control rods and burnable poisons; and (3) single-batch cores. But not all {SMR} designs have all of these traits. The approach used in this study is an example bounding case, and not all {SMRs} may be impacted to the same extent.},

In this forum the graphite-moderated channel type {MSR} based on the previous Oak Ridge National Laboratory research is considered.
The liquid molten salt serves as a fuel and coolant, simultaneously and causes two physical peculiarities: the fission energy is released predominantly directly into the coolant and the delayed neutrons precursors are drifted by the fuel flow. The drift causes the spread of delayed neutrons distribution to the non-core parts of primary circuit and it can lead to a reactivity loss or gain in the case of fuel flow acceleration or deceleration, respectively. Therefore, specific 3D tool based on in house code {DYN}3D was developed in {FZR}. The code {DYN}3D-{MSR} is based on the solution of two-group neutron diffusion equation by the help of a nodal expansion method and it includes models of delayed neutrons drift and specific {MSR} heat release distribution.
In this paper the development and verification of 1D version {DYN}1D-{MSR} of the code is described. The code has been validated with the experimental data gained from the molten salt reactor experiment performed in the Oak Ridge and after the validation it was applied to several typical transients (overcooling of fuel at the core inlet, reactivity insertion, and the fuel pump trip).},

However, during the past few years the implementation of new methodologies has allowed expanding the scope of applications to new fields, including radiation transport and fusion neutronics. These applications pose new challenges for the tracking routines and result estimators, originally developed for a very specific task. The purpose of this paper is to explain how the basic collision estimator based cell flux tally in Serpent 2 is implemented, and how it is applied for calculating integral reaction rates. The methodology and its limitations are demonstrated by an example, in which the tally is applied for calculating collision rates in a problem with very low physical collision density. It is concluded that Serpent has a lot of potential to expand its scope of applications beyond reactor physics, but in order to be applied for such problems it is important that the code users understand the underlying methods and their limitations.},

These weighting methods achieve various levels of success at assembling critical fuel recipes from separated spent fuel streams for fuel cycles incorporating mixed oxide reprocessing.

Here, we report a combined experimental, numerical and theoretical study of a liquid-solid-like phase transition which takes place in a vertically vibrated fluidized granular monolayer. The first experimental setup is a long, narrow channel, with a width of the order of a few particle diameters, hence the dynamics is quasi-one-dimensional. We have considered this configuration to characterize the dynamic behavior of the phase transition. The second setup is used to measure the pressure as function of particle density in order to clarify the physical mechanism behind this phase transition. We demonstrate that the transition is mediated by waves and that it is triggered by a negative compressibility as in van der Waals phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. Finally, in order to further characterize this phase transition, we study static and dynamic correlation functions, and bond-orientational order parameters.},

It aims at analysing the performance of various demand-driven production strategies of a timber production system. This analysis is performed using a simulation platform built on an agent-based advanced planning system. Nine production strategies configurations are evaluated under six scenarios in order to carry out a complete mixed level design of 54 simulation runs. Each of these configurations is a combination of a decoupling point position and a level of capacity that is committed to contracts with customers. Accordingly, the six scenarios are designed as a combination of supply type (i.e. log diameter distribution) and timber market prices. Production processes and co-production yields are based on a real manufacturing system from eastern Canada. Performance is evaluated from the logistic and economic points of view. Results demonstrate that demand-driven planning approaches that propagate demand information upstream the supply chain have the potential to improve planned customer service and reduce planned inventories. Results also show that timber companies need to receive a premium from their customers in order to compensate from the loss of potential value resulting from a more constrained planning environment.},

A neural network ({NN}) ensemble with five {MLPs} (multi-layer perceptrons) performed best among all data-mining algorithms tested and therefore was selected to develop a predictive model. To meet the constraints of the existing energy management applications, Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate uncertainty propagation of the model built by using weather forecast data.

	abstract = {A major problem for the airline industry is the assignment of airplane capacity to flight schedules to meet fluctuating market needs. Demand Driven Dispatch (D³) is an operating concept that addresses this problem. Utilizing a demand forecast which improves as flight departure approaches, aircraft are dynamically assigned to flights to better match the predicted final demands. The result, demonstrated in studies of actual airline systems, is an increase in passenger loads and revenues with simultaneously reduced costs for a net of 1-5\% improvement in operating profits. Concept implementation is simplified by the prevalence of yield management systems which provide the forecasting capability, and the emergence of airplane families which provide the necessary operational flexibility. Implementation also requires frequent solution of extremely large aircraft assignment problems. These problems, which can be formulated in terms of a multicommodity network flow, can be solved with heuristic algorithms shown to exhibit an accuracy and efficiency essential to successful concept implementation.},

	title = {Novel methods for generalizing nuclear fuel cycle design, and fuel burnup modeling},
	url = {https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/45763},
	abstract = {The large number of reactor designs and concepts in existence open up a vast array of nuclear fuel cycle strategies. u. These different reactor types require unique supporting systems from raw material extraction and handling to waste management. Any system designed to model nuclear energy should therefore have methods that are capability of representing a large number of unique fuel cycles. This work examines a user interface designed to generalize the design of nuclear fuel cycles. This software, known as {CycIC}, allows users to interact graphically with a fuel cycle simulator (Cyclus). In this work, the capabilities of {CycIC} were improved through two rounds of rigorous user experience testing. These tests were used as a basis for implementing improvements to the software. Two views inside the software were improved to allow for users to interact with the software more intuitively, and features that provide help to the users were added to improve understanding of fuel cycles and Cyclus. Additionally, this work expands the capabilities of a reactor modeling software (known as Bright-lite) which uses the fluence based neutron balance approach to determine burnup, criticality, and transmutation matrixes for nuclear reactors to augment its modeling of the broadest range of fuel cycle strategies. Specifically, a multi-dimensional interpolation method was implemented to enable reactors to be characterized by sets of cross section libraries which potentially depend on a large number of reactor characteristics. The accuracy of this interpolation method is demonstrated for a number of parameters for light water reactors, and techniques for using this interpolation method to automatically generate reactor libraries for Bright-lite are demonstrated. This research also generalizes the ability of the Bright-lite to blend multiple streams of nuclear fuel while still maintaining constraints. This system is demonstrated for continuous recycle nuclear fuel cycles utilizing light water and fast spectrum reactors. The results show that Bright-lite is capable of blending fuel to reach several targets using up to three different input streams.},

After checking data, tabulated and graphical outputs are given in order to offer the most suitable available values to be used as input parameters for other calculations or simulations. The reviewed values show a general scattering in characterization, mainly in thermal properties.

This study aimed to predict the incidence of {CCHF} and its related factors and explore the possibility of developing an empirical forecast system using time-series analysis of 13 years' data. Data from 2000 to 2012 were obtained from the Health Centre of Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Climate Organization and the Veterinary Organization in the southeast of Iran. Seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average ({SARIMA}) and Markov switching models ({MSM}) were performed to examine the potential related factors of {CCHF} outbreaks. These models showed that the mean temperature (°C), accumulated rainfall (mm), maximum relative humidity (\%) and legal livestock importation from Pakistan ({LIP}) were significantly correlated with monthly incidence of {CCHF} in different lags (P {\textless} 0·05). The modelling fitness was checked with data from 2013. Model assessments indicated that the {MSM} had better predictive ability than the {SARIMA} model [{MSM}: root mean square error ({RMSE}) 0·625, Akaike's Information Criterion ({AIC}) 266·33; {SARIMA}: {RMSE} 0·725, {AIC} 278·8]. This study shows the potential of climate indicators and {LIP} as predictive factors in modelling the occurrence of {CCHF}. Our results suggest that {MSM} provides more information on outbreak detection and can be a better predictive model compared to a {SARIMA} model for evaluation of the relationship between explanatory variables and the incidence of {CCHF}.},

	abstract = {The symbiotic equilibrium between 1.51 {GWe} breeder {SFR} (Sodium Fast Reactors) and 1.6 {GWe} {EPR}™ (European Pressurized water Reactors) is studied. {EPR}™ are only supplied with {MOX} (Mixed {OXide}) fuel to avoid the use of natural uranium. The equilibrium is studied by considering the flows of plutonium. Its isotopic composition is here described by a single real number referred to as the Pu grade. Plutonium flows through both reactor types are characterized by using linear functions of the Pu grade in new fuels. These functions have been determined by fitting data from a former scenario study carried out with the {COSI}6 simulation software.
Two different reprocessing strategies are considered. With joint reprocessing of all spent fuels, total and fissile plutonium flows balance for a unique fraction x of {EPR}™ in the fleet, equal to 0.2547. This x value is consistent with the results reported in the former scenario study mentioned above. When {EPR}™ spent fuels are used in priority to supply {SFR} (distinct reprocessing), x reaches 0.2582 at most. {COSI}6 simulations have been performed to further assess these results. The {EPR}™ fraction in the fleet at symbiotic equilibrium barely depends on the applied reprocessing strategy, so that the more flexible joint reprocessing constitutes the reference option in that case.},

The measuring method was based on the concept of cylindrical symmetry and periodic heat pulses. The seven rocks measured were Westerly (Rhode Island) granite, Climax Stock (Nevada) quartz monzonite, Pomona (Washington) basalt, Atikokan (Ontario, Canada) granite, Creighton (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, East Bull Lake (Ontario, Canada) gabbro, and Stripa (Sweden) granite. The diffusivity of all the rocks showed a positive linear dependence on inverse temperature and, excluding the East Bull Lake gabbro, showed a linear dependence on quartz content. (Quartz content varied from 0 to 31\% by volume.) Diffusivity in all cases rose or remained steady with increasing confining pressure. The pressure effect was strongest at lowest pressures and vanished by levels between 10 and 100 {MPa}, depending on rock type. The pressure effect (measured as a percentage change in diffusivity) is stronger in the four rocks of granitic composition than in the three of basaltic composition. Our results agree well with existing thermal diffusivity measurements at atmospheric pressure.},

valuation to asset management and risk management. Volatility measures the size
of the errors made in modeling returns and other financial variables. It was discovered
that, for vast classes of models, the average size of volatility is not constant but
changes with time and is predictable. Autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity
({ARCH})/generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ({GARCH}) models
and stochastic volatility models are the main tools used to model and forecast volatility.
Moving from single assets to portfolios made of multiple assets, we find that not
only idiosyncratic volatilities but also correlations and covariances between assets are
time varying and predictable. Multivariate {ARCH}/{GARCH} models and dynamic factor
models, eventually in a Bayesian framework, are the basic tools used to forecast
correlations and covariances.},

Especially in the light of the different roadmap exercises that have been undertaken in the past years indicating the need for symbiotic nuclear energy systems in the longer term. The symbiosis between different nuclear reactor types and their associated fuel cycle should fulfill competing objectives for such systems, i.e. economics, environmental friendliness, resource longevity, waste management, and non-proliferation. A new code, dubbed {DANESS}, has been developed which allows performing such dynamic analysis of nuclear energy systems composed of multiple reactors and fuel cycle options including cross-flow of fissile material between the different components of the system. Today, the code allows mass-flow analysis and economics and is currently being extended to include life-cycle analysis data, non-proliferation metrics and non-nuclear energy sources. This paper will describe the main features of this code and will indicate the possible uses and future developments.},

Until recently, repository metrics in such codes were based on mass and were independent of the isotopic composition of the waste. A methodology has been developed for determining peak repository loading for an arbitrary set of isotopics based on the heat load restrictions and current geometry specifications for the Yucca Mountain repository. This model was implemented in the {VISION} fuel cycle scenario analysis code and is used here to study the effects of separation efficiencies on repository loading for various {AFCI} fuel cycle scenarios. Improved separations efficiencies are shown to have continuing technical benefit in fuel cycles that recycle Am and Cm, but a substantial benefit can be achieved with modest separation efficiencies.

The different effects of bed configurations on the flow characteristics of pebble bed are studied through the {PTV} (Particle Tracking Velocimetry) experiment. Some criteria, e.g. flow uniformity (σ) and mass flow level (α), are proposed to estimate vertical velocity field and compare the bed configurations. The distribution of the Δθ (angle difference between the individual particle velocity and the velocity vector sum of all particles) is also used to estimate the resultant motion consistency level. Moreover, for each bed configuration, the thickness of displacement is analyzed to measure the effect of the funnel flow zone based on the boundary layer theory. Detailed information shows the quantified characteristics of bed configuration effects on flow uniformity and other characteristics; and the sequence of levels of each estimation criterion is obtained for all bed configurations. In addition, a good design of the pebble bed configuration is suggested and these estimation criteria can be also applied and adopted in testing other geometry designs of pebble bed.},

As with all simulation tools, fuel cycle simulators require verification through unit tests, benchmark cases, and integral tests. Model validation is a vital aspect, as well. Although comparative studies have been performed, there is no comprehensive unit test and benchmark library for fuel cycle simulator tools. The objective of this paper is to identify some of the “must test” functionalities of a fuel cycle simulator tool within the context of specific problems of interest to the Fuel Cycle Options Campaign within the U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy ({DOE}-{NE}). This paper identifies the features needed to cover the range of promising fuel cycle options identified in the {DOE}-{NE} Fuel Cycle Evaluation and Screening and categorizes these features to facilitate prioritization. Features are categorized as essential functions, integrating features, and exemplary capabilities. A library of unit tests applicable to each of the essential functions should be developed as future work. An international dialog on the functionalities and standard test methods for fuel cycle simulator tools is encouraged.},

	url = {https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/9910034845902121},
	abstract = {This research is focused on developing a model to determine repository loading for an arbitrary isotopic vector based on thermal heat loads for Yucca Mountain. The model will be implemented into a fuel cycle scenario analysis code to investigate repository benefit of various fuel cycles from an integrated systems perspective. Three limiting temperature cases were previously identified from dose limits on the repository: the drift wall at emplacement and closure must remain below 200 °C and the mid- drift point must remain below 96 °C at all times. Based on a pre-existing detailed thermal model of Yucca Mountain, streamlined models were developed for these limiting cases, each with a functional form that captures the appropriate transient effects. The emplacement limit was dependent on the initial heat load as well as the rate at which the heat load was changing. The closure limit was approximated by a constant heat load limit, as the decay heat does not change rapidly near the time of closure. The model for the mid-drift limit uses superposition of individual isotope contributions to the mid-drift temperature rather than decay heat values. Implementation in the {VISION} systems analysis code, offers a powerful tool for studying the effects of an intergraded fuel cycle on repository loading values. A complete repository loading model has never been coupled with a fuel cycle systems code. Effects of delays in the fuel cycle, changes in separation processes, variations in reactor combinations, and other dynamic fuel cycle parameters can now be investigated using this model. Results discussed in this paper show that an increase in separation efficiency above 0.2\% would have less than a 1\% impact on repository loading. However, separation of Cs and Sr into an alternate waste steam results in increased loading of 285 times over a traditional once through cycle for some fuel cycle scenarios. The ability to have a varying time until closure in the systems model also shows a significant impact, reducing the benefit over a once through cycle from 5 times to 2.4 times because of temperature limits at closure.},

In general, countries with on-going nuclear scenarios would profit from {MA} mass stabilization, while transmutation of Pu and {MAs} from {SNF} could be desired in countries in nuclear phase-out. Both missions can be accomplished by employing fast reactors loaded with fuels containing different amounts of Pu and {MAs} in a closed (or partially closed) fuel cycle. In this paper, two 1200 {MWth} sodium-cooled fast reactor cores, based on the French {ASTRID} design, are proposed for burning {TRUs} (phase-out option) or only {MAs} (on-going option). Main attention is focused on the safety and on the transmutation performance. The coolant void effect, in the region including the core and the plenum above and the Doppler constant of both systems are negative also with irradiated fuel. The conversion ratios ({CR}) of the Pu and {MA} burners are in the ranges from 0.6 to 0.7 and from 0.5 to 0.6, respectively. These results show a large safety and transmutation potential of {ASTRID} type reactors.},

In this paper we will present a method for analysing their competitiveness in comparison with thermal neutron reactors. We will use the levelised cost of electricity ({LCOE}) method to compare the production costs of each technology.
For forecasting the uranium cost, which is an important question for competitiveness, we have proposed a model based on supply curve. This model approximates the uranium costs over the assumed 60-year operating lifetime of new reactors, according to their commissioning date.
Concerning the fuel cycle costs, we have taken into account the fact that they will differ according to whether or not the reactor is in a country which has already chosen to treat and recycle spent fuel (back-end of the cycle).
A uranium equivalent value is then calculated for which the {kWh} costs of each reactor technology would be the same. This enables us to determine the period when {FRs} will become competitive according to various parameters.
The uranium supply curve appears to be the most influential parameter for any given nuclear demand, followed by the discount rate, prior choices regarding the back-end of the cycle, and the additional investment cost of {FRs} in comparison with {PWRs}.},

@article{wooten_review_2017,
	title = {A Review of Molten Salt Reactor Kinetics Models (Pre-Publication Draft)},
	abstract = {Interest in circulating fuel reactors ({CFRs}), particularly molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) of the fluid fuel type, has been growing in the last two decades. Starting with a resurgence of interest in Europe, there have been a growing number of methods proposed and codes developed to model the kinetics of {CFRs}; a capability essential to the design and evaluation of such reactors. This work first reviews the physical phenomena unique to {CFRs} in the light of current research and how {CFR} kinetics are impacted by these considerations. In general it is found that the movement of delayed neutron precursors ( {DNPs} ) through the primary loop has significant impacts on transients at low reactor powers or those with significant spatial components such as a change in the primary loop mass flow rate. Effects on the neutron flux are exceedingly minimal and entirely negligible. An extensive review of published models and methods for simulating {CFR} kinetics is presented, along with transient simulations in fast and thermal neutron flux systems using representative codes from each of the main modelling categories. Comparisons between methods are presented as are recommendations for their use or non-use in various transient and work-flow scenarios. In general it is recommended that time-resolved, multi-group neutron diffusion ( {MGD} ) approaches be used to establish ranges of applicability for point reactor kinetics ( {PRK} ) based approaches which themselves may not be applicable for all modelling situations. In such cases it is suggested that quasi- static approaches be used where {PRK} based approaches can not. Finally, a review of common assumptions used in these models is presented, along with an evaluation of their impact on model performance. It is found that neglecting turbulent diffusion in open core type circulating fuel reactors ( {CFRs} ) is a poor assumption which leads to an underestimation of the reduction of the delayed neutron fraction. Additionally it is seen that exclusion of secondary heat transfer loops in models leads to underestimation of transient peaks and troughs.},

	shorttitle = {Politics and Nuclear Power},
	abstract = {With the dramatic changes {OPEC} precipitated in the structure of world energy markets during the 1970s, energy became a central concern to policymakers throughout the industrialized West. This book ex-amines the responses of public officials in three leading European nations -- the Federal Republic of Germany, France, and the Netherlands -- to the energy crisis. As the study shows, the proposed energy programs in the three countries shared remarkable similarities; yet the policy outcomes were very different. To explain why, Michael T. Hatch goes beyond the specific content of government energy policy to include an analysis of the policymaking process itself.At the heart of the study is an exploration of the various dimensions of nuclear policy in West Germany. The political consensus on nuclear power that prevailed in the initial years following the energy crisis disintegrated as antinuclear "citizens' initiatives," the courts, and trade unions, as well as the traditional political parties, entered the policymaking process. Subsequent government efforts to resolve the political stalemate over nuclear power foundered in a morass of domestic electoral politics and an international debate over nuclear proliferation.Extending the analysis to comparisons with French and Dutch nuclear strategies, Hatch argues that the critical factor in determining nuclear policy was the manner in which the political system structured the nuclear debate. In contrast to West Germany, where the electoral and parliamentary systems enhanced the influence of the antinuclear "Greens," the electoral system and constellation of political parties in France served to dissipate the influence of the antinuclear forces. Thus in France the nuclear program en-countered few impediments. In the Netherlands, as in West Germany, government policy was paralyzed in the face of antinuclear sentiment across a broad spectrum of Dutch society.Hatch has provided here not only a useful examination of the development of energy policy in western Europe but also a case study of the close interplay between policy and politics.},

The main cause of the imperfection of nuclear fuel cycle appears in the stage of conversion, enrichment and nuclear fuel fabrication. {TEC} analysis takes into account all connected process starting from natural resources extracting, through all related processes influencing product generation, up to disposal or recycling. For this reason, {TEC} and exergy efficiency evaluate the nuclear fuel life cycle. {TEC} expresses the total (cumulative) exergy consumption of non-renewable resources burdening the analysed product, which means exergy assembly of the whole cycle of this product. {TEC} also takes into account the additional non-renewable exergy consumption required for environmental losses mitigation caused by the harmful emissions. A significant amount of {GHG} (greenhouse gasses) emissions is not covered by the direct analysis since the {CO}2 emissions also occur in the stages of mining and transportation of fuel production. The nuclear power units are characterized by lower {GHG} emissions than the coal and gas technologies, for which the {GHG} emissions is on a comparable level. Additionally, the economic analysis revealed that the investment cost of the nuclear power plant is significantly higher than those of coal or gas power plant the unit cost of electricity generated by the nuclear installation could be about twice lower than from other technologies. It results from an operating cost: the cost of fuel and the fee of direct {GHG} emissions are higher for coal and gas technology than for nuclear power plant. The nuclear power plants seem to be the competitive technologies for the coal or gas installation and should be taken into account while planning the policy for energy generation.},

	abstract = {There is no one model can describe the neutron point kinetic formulation of reactor behaviors. This is due to that nuclear reactor operates in different time regions under different conditions. Therefore, we investigated in this paper several models to explain the performance of neutron point kinetic reactors according to time region of operation. These regions of operation represent the prompt neutron analysis, the delayed supercritical assessment and the transient behavior analysis. The first region of operation is described by neutron jump approximation model. The delayed supercritical one is evaluated by substitution model and combinational analysis model. The transient behavior includes prompt and delayed temperature feedback models. The obtained results are compared with published numerical models and validated using block diagram programming technique. The effects of initial power on the reactor performance are evaluated. Moreover, the influences of inserted positive and negative reactivity on the generated neutron flux density are introduced. The steady state operation of nuclear reactor is improved after step reactivity of ρ0 \&gt; 1β. It is observed that the behavior of delayed neutron precursor increases after 40 s from cold start-up mode. Furthermore, optimum reactivity with step reactivity of ρ = 2β is accomplished that introduces efficient handling of control rod within reactor core. Hence, the neutron dynamic behaviors under variation of control rod positions can be estimated. Thus, safety analysis and transient behaviors during start-up and shutdown of nuclear power plants can be optimized. Consequently, efficient nuclear protection level of nuclear power plant can be fulfilled.},

It is a type of pebble-bed fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor ({PB}-{FHR}). The pebble-bed reactors are composed of randomly distributed fuel pebbles which consist of fully randomly distributed {TRistructural}-{ISOtropic} ({TRISO}) coated-fuel particles. This special structure is known as the double random distribution. However, lacking of accurate modeling approach of random distribution, the regular lattice approximation was adopted in the previous Monte Carlo modeling of the 2-{MW} {TMSR}-{SF}0, which may introduce significant error. In order to explicitly model the random distribution of the {PB}-{FHR}, the random distribution of the {TRISO} coated-fuel particles within fuel pebbles are obtained by the random packing method ({RPM}) and the random distribution of the fuel pebbles within the reactor core are obtained by the discrete element method ({DEM}). In this work, regular lattice approximation approach and explicit modeling approach are applied to simulate the stochastic effect of the {PB}-{FHR}. The simulation results show that regular lattice approximation approach underestimates the keff by about 1000 pcm. Besides, the thermal-neutron scattering effect of 2LiF-{BeF}2 and the resonance elastic scattering effect of uranium are studied in this work.},

	abstract = {{FLiBe} is a molten salt made from a mixture of lithium fluoride ({LiF}) and beryllium fluoride ({BeF}2). It is both a nuclear reactor coolant and solvent for fertile or fissile material. It served both purposes in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}).
The 2:1 mixture forms a stoichiometric compound, Li2BeF4, which has a melting point of 459 °C, a boiling point of 1430 °C, and a density of 1.94 g/cm3. Its volumetric heat capacity is 4540 {kJ}/m3K, which is similar to that of water, more than four times that of sodium, and more than 200 times that of helium at typical reactor conditions. Its appearance is white to transparent, with crystalline grains in a solid state, morphing into a completely clear liquid upon melting. However, soluble fluorides such as {UF}4 and {NiF}2, can dramatically change the color salt in both solid and liquid state. This made spectrophotometry a viable analysis tool, and it was employed extensively during the {MSRE} Operations
The eutectic mixture is slightly greater than 50\% {BeF}2 and has a melting point of 360 °C. This mixture was never used in practice due to the overwhelming increase in viscosity caused by the {BeF}2 addition in the eutectic mixture. {BeF}2, which behaves as a glass, is only fluid in salt mixtures containing enough molar percent of Lewis base. Lewis bases, such as the alkali fluorides, will donate fluoride ions to the beryllium, breaking the glassy bonds which increase viscosity. In {FLiBe}, beryllium fluoride is able to sequester two fluoride ions from two lithium fluorides in a liquid state, converting it into the tetrafluorberyllate ion {BeF}4−2.},

To make this determination, the cost of {SFCF} ({SFR} fuel cycle facilities) was estimated, and the break-even point of the manufacturing cost of {SFR} metallic nuclear fuel for direct disposal option was then calculated. As a result of the cost estimation, the levelized unit cost ({LUC}) for {SFCF} was calculated to be 5,311 \$/{kgHM}, and the break-even point was calculated to be \$5,267/{kgHM}. Therefore, the cost difference between {LUC} and the break-even point is not only small but is also within the relevant range of the uncertainty level of Class 3 in accordance with a generic cost estimate classification matrix of {AACE} (the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering). This means it is very difficult to judge the economical feasibility of {SFR} metallic nuclear fuel because as of today there are no commercial facilities in Korea or the world. The economic feasibility of {SFR} metallic nuclear fuel, however, will be enhanced if the mass production of {SFCF} becomes possible in the future.},

With fusion-based power plants not currently being considered viable for large-scale deployment for at least 40 years, other technologies must to be considered. Renewable and high efficiency combined gas-fired plants, along with nuclear solutions, are regarded as the most suitable candidates, with Small Modular Reactors ({SMRs}) developing as a favoured choice. However, two main impediments to the current deployment of {SMRs} exist: (1) safety concerns, particularly following the Fukushima accident, and (2) their economic models, with high capital costs only being available through a limited number of investors. The goal of this paper is to provide a review and a holistic assessment of this class of nuclear reactor, with specific focus on the most common technology: the Light Water Reactor ({LWR}). In particular, the paper provides a state-of-the-art assessment of their life cycle, along with a comparison of their relative merits with other base-load technologies. It is shown that {SMRs} are a suitable choice when the power to be installed is in the range 1–3 {GWe} and the social aspects of the investment, such as the creation of new employment positions, is a goal of policy makers. The paper thereby provides governments and stakeholders with key economic and social boundaries for the viable deployment of {SMRs}.},

These analyses, Koomey and Hultman (2007); Grubler (2010), and Escobar-Rangel and Lévêque (2015), study only 26\% of reactors built globally between 1960 and 2010, providing an incomplete picture of the economic evolution of nuclear power construction. This study curates historical reactor-specific overnight construction cost ({OCC}) data that broaden the scope of study substantially, covering the full cost history for 349 reactors in the {US}, France, Canada, West Germany, Japan, India, and South Korea, encompassing 58\% of all reactors built globally. We find that trends in costs have varied significantly in magnitude and in structure by era, country, and experience. In contrast to the rapid cost escalation that characterized nuclear construction in the United States, we find evidence of much milder cost escalation in many countries, including absolute cost declines in some countries and specific eras. Our new findings suggest that there is no inherent cost escalation trend associated with nuclear technology.},

	abstract = {In this research paper, a sub-channel thermal hydraulic analysis code is coupled with the point reactor neutron kinetics model with six group delayed neutron. The coupling code is mainly used to perform the transient calculation of {ADS}/lead based alloy cooled fast reactor. The thermal hydraulic model is used for calculating temperature distribution profile and the feedback temperature information, providing input parameters for point kinetic model. This sub-channel analysis model can provide a new approach to solve the problem of one-dimension thermal hydraulic model and simulate the temperature distribution accurately. Furthermore the accuracy and reliability of calculated results are tested by another coupled code named {FLUENT}/{PK} and good agreements are achieved. To improve computational speed, one equivalent assembly is used to replace the whole core and the study shows that using of equivalent assembly which has the same average outlet temperature with the core obtained more reasonable results. The effects of fuel rods pitch diameter P/D ratio on simulation results are discussed. The code is capable to the quick calculations and safety analysis for reactivity accidents.},

	abstract = {High-level nuclear waste—one of the nation’s most hazardous
substances—is accumulating at 80 sites in 35 states. The United States has generated 70,000 metric tons of nuclear waste and is expected to generate 153,000 metric tons by 2055. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, requires the Department of Energy ({DOE}) to dispose of the waste in a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, about 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada. However, the repository is more than a decade behind schedule, and the nuclear waste generally remains at the
commercial nuclear reactor sites and {DOE} sites where it was
generated. 
This report examines the key attributes, challenges, and costs of
the Yucca Mountain repository and the two principal alternatives to a repository that nuclear waste management experts identified:
storing the nuclear waste at two centralized locations and continuing to store the waste on site where it was generated. {GAO}
developed models of total cost ranges for each alternative using
component cost estimates provided by the nuclear waste management experts. However, {GAO} did not compare these alternatives because of significant differences in their inherent characteristics that could not be quantified.},

	abstract = {The International Atomic Energy Agency is giving continuous attention to the collection,
analysis and exchange of information on issues of back-end of the nuclear fuel cycle, an
important part of the nuclear fuel cycle. Reprocessing of spent fuel arising from nuclear
power production is one of the strategies for the back end of the fuel cycle. As a major
fraction of spent fuel is made up of uranium, chemical reprocessing of spent fuel would leave
behind large quantities of separated uranium which is designated as reprocessed uranium
({RepU}). Reprocessing of spent fuel could form a crucial part of future fuel cycle
methodologies, which currently aim to separate and recover plutonium and minor actinides.
The use of reprocessed uranium ({RepU}) and plutonium reduces the overall environmental
impact of the entire fuel cycle. Environmental considerations will be important in determining
the future growth of nuclear energy. It should be emphasized that the recycling of fissile
materials not only reduces the toxicity and volumes of waste from the back end of the fuel
cycle; it also reduces requirements for fresh milling and mill tailings. In comparison, the
method of direct disposal of spent fuel premeditates creation of larger capacity repositories for
permanent disposal. The issue of recycle and reuse of valuable material is important for the
nuclear fuel cycle in the context of sustainable growth of the nuclear energy. Recognizing the
importance of this subject, the International Atomic Energy Agency initiated the preparation
of this report to review and summarize information available on the management of
reprocessed uranium.},

	abstract = {A Monte Carlo-based Bayesian inference model is applied to the prediction of reactor operation parameters of a {PWR} nuclear power plant. In this non-perturbative framework, high-dimensional covariance information describing the uncertainty of microscopic nuclear data is combined with measured reactor operation data in order to provide statistically sound, well founded uncertainty estimates of integral parameters, such as the boron letdown curve and the burnup-dependent reactor power distribution. The performance of this methodology is assessed in a blind test approach, where we use measurements of a given reactor cycle to improve the prediction of the subsequent cycle. As it turns out, the resulting improvement of the prediction quality is impressive. In particular, the prediction uncertainty of the boron letdown curve, which is of utmost importance for the planning of the reactor cycle length, can be reduced by one order of magnitude by including the boron concentration measurement information of the previous cycle in the analysis. Additionally, we present first results of non-perturbative nuclear-data updating and show that predictions obtained with the updated libraries are consistent with those induced by Bayesian inference applied directly to the integral observables.},

In the heterogeneous approach, minor actinides are loaded in specially designed targets assemblies which are located in the periphery of the core, in order to limit the impacts on core operations. In this paper, we compare the use of uranium and thorium dioxide as support matrix in which minor actinides are diluted in the target assemblies. Both {UO}2 and {ThO}2 exhibit sufficiently good irradiation behavior to withstand the long residence time associated with heterogeneous transmutation. Five different reprocessing strategies are compared in which some or all the elements in the blankets are reused after reprocessing. The impacts on core safety parameters and fuel cycle parameters are also evaluated for each case and it is found that using thorium as support matrix with reuse of uranium 233 leads to transmutation performances similar to the one obtained with the reuse of plutonium from uranium blankets with slightly lower global impacts on reactor operation and fuel cycle.},

	abstract = {Deep decarbonization of the global energy system will require large investments in energy innovation and the deployment of new technologies. While many studies have focused on the expenditure that will be needed, here we focus on how government has spent public sector resources on innovation for a key carbon-free technology: advanced nuclear. We focus on nuclear power because it has been contributing almost 20\% of total {US} electric generation, and because the {US} program in this area has historically been the world’s leading effort. Using extensive data acquired through the Freedom of Information Act, we reconstruct the budget history of the Department of Energy’s program to develop advanced, non-light water nuclear reactors. Our analysis shows that—despite spending \$2 billion since the late 1990s—no advanced design is ready for deployment. Even if the program had been well designed, it still would have been insufficient to demonstrate even one non-light water technology. It has violated much of the wisdom about the effective execution of innovative programs: annual funding varies fourfold, priorities are ephemeral, incumbent technologies and fuels are prized over innovation, and infrastructure spending consumes half the budget. Absent substantial changes, the possibility of {US}-designed advanced reactors playing a role in decarbonization by mid-century is low.},

However, the political uncertainty in many countries about the future of nuclear energy source clearly illustrates that there is a need for a global approach to compare nuclear energy with other energy sources and draw its potential future improvements. Indeed, beyond the well-known economic aspect, many other criteria are also implicitly considered when choosing a relevant energy mix to be implemented in a given country. This rather recent situation requires extending the classical approach based on the technological and economic optimization to a wider approach also including the overall environmental footprint and the more general social acceptance. Sustainability approach includes the different criteria describing the environmental, economic and societal fields. Therefore, it may be relevant to identify the current key figures of nuclear energy, and help to identify the most promising improvement directions. In this paper, we propose to assess the current nuclear fuel cycles regarding the different sustainability criteria. We will also address the most relevant improvements to be implemented in the future to ensure the sustainability of nuclear energy and support its development.},

Thermo-physical properties and transport properties of liquid and vapor fluoride salts are implemented into the {RELAP}5 {MOD}3.2 source code, through which the application of the {RELAP}5 {MOD}3.2 can be extended from the water-cooled reactors to the {FHRs}.

A {RELAP}5 model is developed for the {MK}1 Pebble Bed Fluoride-Salt-Cooled High-Temperature Reactor ({MK}1 {PB}-{FHR}). Using the modified code, two basic postulated transients including the unprotected loss of forced circulation ({ULOFC}) and unprotected transient overpower ({UTOP}), are investigated to explore the safety characteristics of the {MK}1 {PB}-{FHR}. Results show that the core outlet temperature may exceed its limit in the {ULOFC} caused by two main pumps trip. It can be also concluded that the passive residual heat removal system can mitigate the consequences of the {ULOFC}. Results of the sensitivity analysis of the {UTOP} indicate that the reactor power and core temperatures show a linear increment trend versus the positive reactivity insertion.},

	abstract = {Metal Matrix Micro-encapsulated (M3) fuel consists of {TRISO} coated fuel particles directly dispersed in a matrix of zirconium metal to form a solid rod. In this integral fuel concept the cladding tube and the failure mechanisms associated with it have been eliminated; therefore, M3 fuel, compared to existing fuel designs, is expected to provide greatly improved operational performance. The main challenge to the deployment of M3 fuels is the low heavy metal load. This needs to be compensated with high density fuel (uranium nitride), larger rods and mainly higher enrichment. This study found that M3 fuel requires about 15.5\% enriched {UN} {TRISO} particles to match the cycle length of standard fuel when loaded in a {PWR}. In order to achieve comparable reactivity feedbacks, in particular moderator temperature, the pitch to rod diameter ratio should be reduced to 1.20 compared to the typical 1.326. As M3 fuel provides a better path for heat transfer from the fuel, such smaller pitch is expected to be feasible, but further evaluations especially to examine thermal-hydraulic aspects are required. Analyses of possible load patterns for burnable poisons showed that M3 fuel maintains similar cycle length to that of standard fuel and pin power peaks are also comparable. Nevertheless, further optimization will be required to limit assembly power peaks.},

Results are presented for the sensitivity of {PCT} and the duration time of film boiling to the key parameters in the boiling curve: nucleate, transition, and film boiling heat transfer coefficient, and {CHF}. This included a generic study of perturbations in boiling heat transfer characteristics for Zircaloy-4 cladding as well as a study which focused on the key candidate {ATF} cladding types. For Zircaloy-4 cladding, the simulation results show that both {PCT} and duration of film boiling are particularly sensitive to the value of {CHF}. We also compared the performance of {FeCrAl} claddings and {SiC}/{SiC} claddings with Zircaloy-4 cladding under the same {RIA} scenario. A 10\% {CHF} enhancement for {FeCrAl} cladding can significantly reduce the {PCT} of {FeCrAl} claddings. Lower irradiated thermal conductivity of {SiC}/{SiC} claddings does cause a high temperature gradient in the radial direction.},

	abstract = {In nuclear reactors, thermal neutron spectra are formed using moderators with small atomic weights. For fast reactors, inserting such moderators in the core may create problems since they efficiently decelerate the neutrons. In order to form an intermediate neutron spectrum, it is preferable to employ neutron moderators with sufficiently large atomic weights, using 233U as a fissile nuclide and 232Th and 231Pa as fertile ones. The aim of the work is to investigate the properties of heavy neutron moderators and to assess their advantages. The analysis employs the {JENDL}-4.0 nuclear data library and the {SCALE} program package for simulating the variation of fuel composition caused by irradiation in the reactor. The following main results are obtained. By using heavy moderators with small neutron moderation steps, one is able to (1) increase the rate of resonance capture, so that the amount of fertile material in the fuel may be reduced while maintaining the breeding factor of the core; (2) use the vacant space for improving the fuel-element properties by adding inert, strong, and thermally conductive materials and by implementing dispersive fuel elements in which the fissile material is self-replenished and neutron multiplication remains stable during the process of fuel burnup; and (3) employ mixtures of different fertile materials with resonance capture cross sections in order to increase the resonance-lattice density and the probability of resonance neutron capture leading to formation of fissile material. The general conclusion is that, by forming an intermediate neutron spectrum with heavy neutron moderators, one can use the fuel more efficiently and improve nuclear safety.},

Transient characteristics of {FHR} are particularly important for evaluating its operation performance. Thus, a specialized code {OCFHR} (operation and control analysis code of {FHR}) issued to study an experimental {FHR}’s operation behaviors. The geometric modeling of {OCFHR} is based on one-dimensional lumped parameter method, and some simplifications are taken into consideration during simulation due to the existence of complex structures such as pebble bed, intermediate heat exchanger ({IHX}), air radiator ({AR}) and multiply channels. A point neutron kinetics model is developed, and neutron physics calculation is needed to provide some key inputs including axial power density distribution, reactivity coefficients and parameters about delayed neutron precursors. For analyzing the operational performance, five disturbed transients are simulated, involving reactivity step insertion, variations of coolant mass flow rate of primary loop and intermediate loop, adjustment of air inlet temperature and mass flow rate of air cooling system. Simulation results indicate that inherent self-stability of {FHR} restrains severe consequences under above transients, and some dynamic features are observed, such as large negative temperature feedbacks, remarkable thermal inertia and high response delay.},

Once the design life of the {IMSR} is reached, for example, in the range of 3 to 10 years, it is disconnected, removed and replaced as a unit. The spent {IMSR} functions as the medium or long term storage of the radioactive graphite and/or heat exchangers and/or control rods and/or fuel salt contained in the vessel of the {IMSR}. The present also relates to a nuclear reactor that has a buffer salt surrounding the nuclear vessel. During normal operation of the nuclear reactor, the nuclear reactor operates at a temperature that is lower than the melting point of the buffer salt and the buffer salt acts as a thermal insulator. Upon loss of external cooling, the temperature of the nuclear reactor increases and melts the buffer salt, which can then transfer heat from the nuclear core to a cooled containment vessel.},

This method is based upon the direct coupling of a code for nuclear fuel isotopic characterization ({ORIGEN}-S) to a model for proliferation resistance, based upon a generalized fuel cycle model. The resulting coupled model is applied to evaluate {PR} as a dynamic system property as a function of three fuel cycle categories: open cycles, a “modified open cycle” ({MOC}) consisting of limited actinide recycle, and a fully closed cycle. Proliferation resistance is evaluated along several key operational parameters of the chosen fuel cycles, including fuel burnup and actinide separation strategies (including uranium and minor actinide co-extraction). For purposes of demonstration, a {PR} model developed at {NC} State shall be used for fuel cycle {PR} evaluation; the mechanics of this model will be presented in brief.},

Energy touches our lives in countless ways and its costs are felt when we fill up at the gas pump, pay our home heating bills, and keep businesses both large and small running. There are long-term costs as well: to the environment, as natural resources are depleted and pollution contributes to global climate change, and to national security and independence, as many of the world's current energy sources are increasingly concentrated in geopolitically unstable regions. The country's challenge is to develop an energy portfolio that addresses these concerns while still providing sufficient, affordable energy reserves for the nation.
The United States has enormous resources to put behind solutions to this energy challenge; the dilemma is to identify which solutions are the right ones. Before deciding which energy technologies to develop, and on what timeline, we need to understand them better.
America's Energy Future analyzes the potential of a wide range of technologies for generation, distribution, and conservation of energy. This book considers technologies to increase energy efficiency, coal-fired power generation, nuclear power, renewable energy, oil and natural gas, and alternative transportation fuels. It offers a detailed assessment of the associated impacts and projected costs of implementing each technology and categorizes them into three time frames for implementation.},

	abstract = {The worldwide expansion of nuclear energy has been accompanied by concerns about nuclear weapons proliferation. If sited in states that do not possess nuclear weapons technology, some civilian nuclear technologies could provide a route for states or other organizations to acquire nuclear weapons. Metrics for assessing the resistance of a nuclear technology to diversion for non-peaceful uses-proliferation resistance-have been developed, but at present there is no clear consensus on whether and how these metrics are useful to policy decision makers. 

In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy asked the National Academies to convene a public workshop addressing the capability of current and potential methodologies for assessing host state proliferation risk and resistance to meet the needs of decision makers. Proliferation Risk in Nuclear Fuel Cycles is a summary of presentations and discussions that transpired at the workshop-held on August 1-2, 2011-prepared by a designated rapporteur following the workshop. It does not provide findings and recommendations or represent a consensus reached by the symposium participants or the workshop planning committee. However, several themes emerged through the workshop: nonproliferation and new technologies, separate policy and technical cultures, value of proliferation resistance analysis, usefulness of social science approaches. 

The workshop was organized as part of a larger project undertaken by the {NRC}, the next phase of which (following the workshop) will be a consensus study on improving the assessment of proliferation risks associated with nuclear fuel cycles. This study will culminate in a report prepared by a committee of experts with expertise in risk assessment and communication, proliferation metrics and research, nuclear fuel cycle facility design and engineering, international nuclear nonproliferation and national security policy, and nuclear weapons design. This report is planned for completion in the spring of 2013.},

Simulations of light water reactor ({LWR}) fuel burn-up through three operational reactor power cycles are conducted to explore the possible xenon isotopic signature of nuclear reactor releases under different operational conditions. It is studied how ratio changes are related to various parameters including the neutron flux, uranium enrichment and fuel burn-up. Further, the impact of diffusion and mixing on the isotopic activity ratio variability are explored. The simulations are validated with reported reactor emissions. In addition, activity ratios are calculated for xenon isotopes released from nuclear explosions and these are compared to the reactor ratios in order to determine whether the discrimination of explosion releases from reactor effluents is possible based on isotopic activity ratios.},

Transitioning to advanced nuclear energy systems improves sustainability and promotes energy independence. These advanced nuclear energy systems also must be shown to enhance safety, safeguards, and security in order to be realistically deployed. This is of particular concern to non–nuclear weapons states, to assure compliance with International Atomic Energy Agency treaty obligations. Consequently, the relatively new research area of safeguardability addresses how to integrate goals for safety, safeguards, and security as part of a design strategy for an advanced fuel cycle. This paper presents an overall set of principles that form the foundation of a comprehensive safeguardability methodology, including the quantitative modeling studies derived therein. Results show an approach for characterizing used fuel, functional components to engineering design for nuclear materials handling facilities, and repository analysis. We conclude with an argument for the necessity of an integrative, systems assessment approach to the safeguardability of an advanced fuel cycle.},

power around the world. We begin with a discussion of the ‘but for’ baseline and the
much discussed ‘nuclear renaissance.’ Our pre-Fukushima benchmark for growth in
nuclear generation in the U.S. and other developed countries is much more modest than
many bullish forecasts of a big renaissance in new capacity may have suggested. For at
least the next decade in developed countries, it is composed primarily of life extensions
for many existing reactors, modest uprates of existing reactors as their licenses are
extended, and modest levels of new construction. The majority of forecasted new
construction is centered in China, Russia and the former states of the {FSU}, India and
South Korea. In analyzing the impact of Fukushima, we break the effect down into two
categories: the impact on existing plants, and the impact on the construction of new units.
In both cases, we argue that the accident at Fukushima will contribute to a reduction in
future trends in the expansion of nuclear energy, but at this time these effects appear to be
quite modest at the global level.},

Le problème est aussi de type multi-objectif (plusieurs performances) à grand nombre de dimensions (plusieurs dizaines de paramètres de conception).Les codes de calculs déterministes utilisés traditionnellement pour la caractérisation des coeurs demandant d’importantes ressources informatiques, l’approche de conception classique rend difficile l’exploration et l’optimisation de nouveaux concepts innovants. Afin de pallier ces difficultés, une nouvelle méthodologie a été développée lors de ces travaux de thèse. Ces travaux sont basés sur la mise en oeuvre et la validation de schémas de calculs neutronique et thermo-hydraulique pour disposer d’un outil de caractérisation d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides à caloporteur sodium tant du point de vue des performances neutroniques que de son comportement en transitoires accidentels.La méthodologie mise en oeuvre s’appuie sur la construction de modèles de substitution (ou métamodèles) aptes à remplacer la chaîne de calcul neutronique et thermo-hydraulique. Des méthodes mathématiques avancées pour la planification d’expériences, la construction et la validation des métamodèles permettent de remplacer cette chaîne de calcul par des modèles de régression au pouvoir de prédiction élevé.La méthode est appliquée à un concept innovant de coeur à Faible coefficient de Vidange sur un très large domaine d’étude, et à son comportement lors de transitoires thermo-hydrauliques non protégés pouvant amener à des situations incidentelles, voire accidentelles. Des analyses globales de sensibilité permettent d’identifier les paramètres de conception influents sur la conception du coeur et son comportement en transitoire. Des optimisations multicritères conduisent à des nouvelles configurations dont les performances sont parfois significativement améliorées. La validation des résultats produits au cours de ces travaux de thèse démontre la pertinence de la méthode au stade de la préconception d’un coeur de réacteur à neutrons rapides refroidi au sodium.},

	abstract = {The {UK} Government has made a commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80\% from 1990 levels by 2050. Achieving this goal may demand a significant expansion of nuclear power and the Government has been exploring some very challenging scenarios with up to 75 {GWe} of nuclear capacity by 2050. Prior to establishing a national R\&amp;D programme, the Government commissioned the National Nuclear Laboratory ({NNL}) and the Dalton Nuclear Institute ({DNI}) to lead a preliminary R\&amp;D programme to fill in some gaps that have been identified. This initial R\&amp;D included a programme of work on Strategic Assessment, which will look at possible future energy and nuclear deployment scenarios to identify the important constraints and limitations. The nuclear expansion scenarios envisage a new build programme based on a Light Water Reactor ({LWR}) fleet and in some of these scenarios the {LWRs} are at some point replaced by a fleet of fast reactors with recycle that would allow a self-sustaining fuel cycle independent of world uranium supplies. This paper focuses on the high level conclusions that arise from the fast reactor scenarios studied. The high level conclusions relate to constraints on timescales for expansion of nuclear capacity and technical specifications for fuel cycle and waste management plants. In particular the work illustrates how the driving factors for fast reactor deployment have changed since the {UK} was last involved seriously in fast reactor development work in the mid-1990s.},

The fitness function was designed so that the genetic algorithm creates fuel reloads that, on one hand, satisfy the constrictions for the radial power peaking factor, the minimum critical power ratio, and the maximum linear heat generation rate while optimizing the effective multiplication factor at the beginning and end of the cycle. To find the values of these variables, a neural network trained with the behavior of a reactor simulator was used to predict them. The computation time is therefore greatly decreased in the search process. We validated this method with data from five cycles of the Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant in Mexico.},

	abstract = {The In-Core Fuel Management Optimization ({ICFMO}) is a prominent problem in Nuclear Engineering. In the present paper, the application of the Cross Entropy ({CE}) method to the {ICFMO} is described. The {CE} method was initially developed for rare event simulation, and adapted to combinatorial and continuous optimization. Unlike the several metaheuristics biologically or physically inspired that have been applied to the {ICFMO}, the {CE} is an algorithm based on statistics and information theory, specifically on the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence (or cross entropy). Notwithstanding the high level theory underlying the algorithm, its implementation mainly comprises the sampling of candidate solutions at each iteration with an update of parameters for generating the random sample in the next iteration given by the analysis of an elite group within the sample. Thus, it is possible to drive the algorithm to optimal or near optimal solutions iteratively. The {CE} algorithm was applied to the optimization of the 7th cycle of Angra 1 Nuclear Power Plant, in Brazil. The results compare favorably to other algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Population Based Incremental Learning, as well as Particle Swarm Optimization under the same conditions of simulation.},

In modeling {FA} with reshuffled pins, as prerequisite, the single pin calculation method is proposed to estimate the isotopic compositions of each pin of burnt {FA} in the core-wide environment. Subsequently, such estimation has been verified by comparing with the neutronic performance of the reference design. Two scenarios are concerned, i.e., first scenario was targeted on the improvement of the uniform flux spatial distribution and on the enhancement of neutron economy by simply reshuffling the existing fuel pins in once-burnt fuel assemblies, and second one was focused on reduction of fresh fuel loading and discharged fuel assemblies with more economic incentives by reusing some available spent fuel pins still carrying enough reactivity that are mechanically sound ascertained. In scenario-1, the operating time was merely somewhat increased for few minutes when treating eight {FAs} by keeping enough safety margins. The scenario-2 was proved to reduce four fresh {FAs} loading without largely losing any targeted parameters from the safety aspect despite loss of 14 effective full power days for operation at reference plant full rated power.},

	abstract = {The efficient operation and in-core fuel management of {PWRs} are of utmost importance. In the present work, a core reload optimization using Shuffled Frog Leaping ({SFL}) algorithm is addressed and mapped on nuclear fuel loading pattern optimization. {SFL} is one of the latest meta-heuristic optimization algorithms which is used for solving the discrete optimization problems and inspired from social behavior of frogs. The algorithm initiates the search from an initial population and carries forward to draw out an optimum result. This algorithm employs the use of memetic evolution by exchanging ideas between the members of the population in each local search. The local search of {SFL} is similar to particle swarm optimization ({PSO}) and applying shuffling process accomplishes the information exchange between several local searches to obtain an overall optimum result. To evaluate the proposed technique, Shekel’s Foxholes and a {VVER}-1000 reactor are used as test cases to illustrate performance of {SFL}. Among numerous neutronic and thermal-hydraulic objectives necessary for a fuel management problem to reach an overall optimum, this paper deals with two neutronic objectives, i.e., maximizing effective multiplication factor and flattening power distribution in the core, to evaluate the capability of applying {SFL} algorithm for a fuel management problem. The results, convergence rate and reliability of the method are quite promising and show the potential and efficiency of the technique for other optimization applications in the nuclear engineering field.},

Several algorithm improvements were implemented and evaluated. The most significant of these are variable sampling probabilities and sampling new fuel types from an ordered array. A heuristic control rod pattern ({CRP}) search algorithm was also implemented, which is useful for single {CRP} determinations, however, this feature requires significant computational resources and is currently not practical for use in a full multi-cycle optimization. The {PSA} algorithm was demonstrated to be capable of significant objective function reduction and finding candidate loading patterns without constraint violations. The use of variable sampling probabilities was shown to reduce runtime while producing better results compared to using constant sampling probabilities. Sampling new fuel types from an ordered array was shown to have a mixed effect compared to random new fuel type sampling, whereby using both random and ordered sampling produced better results but required longer runtimes.},

concepts in the design of C {YCLUS} include open access to the

detail and security of proprietary or sensitive data.
When comparing different nuclear fuel cycle concepts, it
can be a challenge to find any two systems analyses that com-
pare across a common set of metrics with a similar set of un-
derlying assumptions. Each analysis is likely to focus on a set
of metrics that are of interest to the team performing the analy-
sis and involve both implicit and explicit assumptions and con-
straints about the behavior of the fuel cycle system. While
a strict prescription of these metrics, assumptions and con-
straints could be proposed for comparison purposes, another
solution is to provide a systems analysis simulation tool that
provides sufficient modularity, extensibility and open access,
that it can be a basis for harmonzing to a common set. If it
becomes easier to modify an existing simulation tool to sup-
port the needs of a new analysis than it is to develop a new
tool, then it is possible that such a tool will be adopted more

	abstract = {The University of California, Berkeley ({UCB}), has developed a preconceptual design for a commercial pebble-bed ({PB}), fluoride salt–cooled, high-temperature reactor ({FHR}) ({PB}-{FHR}). The baseline design for this Mark-I {PB}-{FHR} (Mk1) plant is a 236-{MW}(thermal) reactor. The Mk1 uses a fluoride salt coolant with solid, coated-particle pebble fuel. The Mk1 design differs from earlier {FHR} designs because it uses a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle designed to produce 100 {MW}(electric) of base-load electricity using a modified General Electric 7FB gas turbine. For peak electricity generation, the Mk1 has the ability to boost power output up to 242 {MW}(electric) using natural gas co-firing. The Mk1 uses direct heating of the power conversion fluid (air) with the primary coolant salt rather than using an intermediate coolant loop. By combining results from computational neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and pebble dynamics, {UCB} has developed a detailed design of the annular core and other key functional features. Both an active normal shutdown cooling system and a passive, natural-circulation-driven emergency decay heat removal system are included. Computational models of the {FHR}-validated using experimental data from the literature and from scaled thermal-hydraulic facilities-have led to a set of design criteria and system requirements for the Mk1 to operate safely and reliably. Three-dimensional, computer-aided-design models derived from the Mk1 design criteria are presented.},

understanding of coexisting phases, as well as the transitions between them. In contrast, the theory fails with granular matter because
collisions between the grains dissipate energy, and their macroscopic size renders thermal fluctuations negligible. When a mass of
grains is subjected to mechanical vibration, it can make a transition to a fluid state. In this state, granular matter exhibits patterns and
instabilities that resemble those of molecular fluids. Here, we report a granular solid–liquid phase transition in a vibrating granular
monolayer. Unexpectedly, the transition is mediated by waves and is triggered by a negative compressibility, as for van der Waals
phase coexistence, although the system does not satisfy the hypotheses used to understand atomic systems. The dynamic behaviour
that we observe—coalescence, coagulation and wave propagation—is common to a wide class of phase transitions. We have combined
experimental, numerical and theoretical studies to build a theoretical framework for this transition.},

	title = {Current Status of Predictive Transition Capability in Fuel Cycle Simulation},
	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle simulation scenarios are most naturally described as 
constrained objective functions. The objectives are often systemic 
demands such as ``achieve 1\% growth for total electricity production 
and reach 10\% uranium utilization''. The constraints take 
the form of nuclear fuel cycle technology availability 
(``reprocessing begins after 2025 and fast reactors first become 
available in 2050'').

To match the natural constrained objective form of the scenario 
definition, {NFC} simulators must bring demand responsive 
deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic.

In particular, a {NFC} simulator should have the 
capability to deploy supporting fuel cycle facilities to enable 
a demand to be met. Take, for instance, the standard once through fuel 
cycle. Reactors may be deployed to meet a objective power demand. 
However, new mines, mills, and enrichment facilities will also need to be 
deployed to ensure that reactors have sufficient fuel to produce power.  
In many simulators, the unrealistic solution to this problem is to 
simply have infinite capacity support facilities. Alternatively, 
detailing the deployment timeline of all facilities becomes the 
responsibility of the user.

The authors seek to identify the most flexible, general, and performant 
algorithms applicable to this modeling challenge.  Accordingly, a review was 
conducted of current {NFC} simulation tools to determine the 
current capabilites for demand-driven and transition scenarios. 
Additionally, the authors investigated promising algorithmic
innovations that have been successful for similar applications in other domains
such as economics and industrial engineering.},

The Navier-Stokes equations are then reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations by Galerkin projection. The flow field is reconstructed and used to advect the temperature on longer time scales and potentially coarser grids. The methodology is validated and tested on two problems: two-dimensional flow past a cylinder and three-dimensional flow in T-junctions. For the latter case, the benchmark chosen corresponds to the experiments of Hirota et al., who performed particle image velocimetry on the flow in a counterflow T-junction. In both test problems the dynamics of the reduced-order model reproduce well the history of the projected modes when a sufficient number of equations are considered. The dynamics of flow evolution and the interaction of different modes are also studied in detail for the T-junction.},

While the natural thorium isotope Th-232 can finally be transformed to a fissile U-233 nucleus following a thermal neutron capture reaction, the existence of thorium in the nature and its potential use in the nuclear technology were not unfortunately into account with a sufficient importance. This was probably because of the geological availability of natural resources of thorium and uranium. Global distributions of thorium and uranium reserves clearly indicate that in general some developed countries such as the {USA}, Canada, Australia have considerable uranium reserves and contrarily only some developing countries such as Brazil, Turkey, India, Egypt have considerable thorium reserves as being totally about 70 \% of the global reserve. All technical parameters obtained from the studies on thorium fuel cycle during the last 50 years indicate that thorium fuel cycle can be used in most of reactor types already operated. In addition, accelerated-driven hybrid systems promise to use the thorium based nuclear fuels. So, thorium will probably be a nuclear material much more valuable than uranium in the future. For this reason, all developing countries having thorium reserves should focus their technological attentions to the evaluation of their national thorium resources like in the case of India. In this paper a brief story on the studies of thorium and its potential use in the future energy production technology have been summarized.},

In order to lower the amount of nuclear wastes sent to the geological repository, an optimized scattered reloading scheme for {ADS} is proposed to maximize the discharge burnup and lower the burnup reactivity loss. Then the flexibility of {ADS} for {MA} transmutation is evaluated in this research. Three aspects are discussed, including: different cooling time of spent {ADS} fuels before reprocessing, different reprocessing loss of spent {ADS} fuels, and different top-up {MAs} recovered from different kinds of spent {PWR} fuels. The {ADS} system is flexible to be combined with various pyro-chemical reprocessing technologies with specific spent fuels cooling time and unique reprocessing loss. The reduction magnitudes of the long-term decay heat and radiotoxicity of {MAs} by transmutation depend on the reprocessing loss. The {ADS} system is flexible to transmute {MAs} recovered from different kinds of spent {PWR} fuels, regardless of {UOX} or {MOX} fuels.

A system dynamics model was developed in this study using {STELLA} platform to model the energy consumption and {CO}2 emission trends for the City of Beijing over 2005–2030. Results show that the total energy demand in Beijing is predicted to reach 114.30 million tonnes coal equivalent (Mtce) by 2030, while that value in 2005 is 55.99Mtce, which is 1.04 times higher than the level in 2005. Accordingly, the total {CO}2 emissions in 2030 will reach 169.67 million tonnes {CO}2 equivalent (Mt {CO}2-eq), 0.43 times higher than that of 2005. The change of energy structure from carbon rich fuel as coal to low-carbon fuel as natural gas will play a very essential role in carbon emission reduction activities of Beijing. The modeling results also shows that the service sector will gradually replace the industrial dominant status in energy consumption as the largest energy consuming sector, followed by industrial and transport sector. The sensitive analysis suggests that change of economic development mode and control of rational population growth will have a far-reaching influence on energy consumption and on carbon emissions. All these results will provide essential information for Beijing's future energy and carbon emission profiles.},

Under a business-as-usual ({BAU}) scenario, total energy demand in Shanghai will rise to 300 million tons of coal equivalent in 2020, which is 3.91 times that of 2005. Total {CO}2 emissions in 2010 and 2020 will reach 290 and 630 million tons, respectively, under the {BAU} scenario. Under a basic-policy ({BP}) scenario, total energy demand in Shanghai will be 160 million tons of coal equivalent in 2020, which is 2.06 times that of 2005. Total {CO}2 emissions in 2010 and 2020 in Shanghai will be 210 and 330 million tons, respectively, 28\% and 48\% lower than those of the business-as-usual scenario. The results show that the currently planned energy conservation policies for the future, represented by the basic-policy scenario, have a large {CO}2 mitigation potential for Shanghai.},

	abstract = {We present a dynamic model of the indigenous natural gas industry in the {UK}. The model has been built using a system dynamics approach. Using the model several scenarios have been analyzed. We found that management of the supply-side policy alone cannot substantially postpone the discovery, production and consumption peak. We also found that the dynamics of the main variables, namely, exploration, production and consumption, are sensitive to initial demand conditions. Postponing the onset of gas price increases can therefore be achieved more effectively through efforts to reduce demand growth. One might expect that a low taxation policy would encourage more exploration and production of gas and thereby stimulate higher consumption rates. Instead, there was no overall net effect on production and consumption in the long term. The depletion effect on cost of exploration acts as counterbalance to low taxation policy. Depletion effect causes cost and thus price to rise further which depress consumption rate. The advances in exploration and production technology can delay the peak of exploration, production and consumption. Technological improvements mean lower cost of exploration and production which pressure down the long-term pattern of price dynamics.},

	abstract = {Electricity is conceivably the most multipurpose energy carrier in modern global economy, and therefore primarily linked to human and economic development. Energy sector reform is critical to sustainable energy development and includes reviewing and reforming subsidies, establishing credible regulatory frameworks, developing policy environments through regulatory interventions, and creating market-based approaches. Energy security has recently become an important policy driver and privatization of the electricity sector has secured energy supply and provided cheaper energy services in some countries in the short term, but has led to contrary effects elsewhere due to increasing competition, resulting in deferred investments in plant and infrastructure due to longer-term uncertainties. On the other hand global dependence on fossil fuels has led to the release of over 1100GtCO2 into the atmosphere since the mid-19th century. Currently, energy-related {GHG} emissions, mainly from fossil fuel combustion for heat supply, electricity generation and transport, account for around 70\% of total emissions including carbon dioxide, methane and some traces of nitrous oxide. This multitude of aspects play a role in societal debate in comparing electricity generating and supply options, such as cost, {GHG} emissions, radiological and toxicological exposure, occupational health and safety, employment, domestic energy security, and social impressions. Energy systems engineering provides a methodological scientific framework to arrive at realistic integrated solutions to complex energy problems, by adopting a holistic, systems-based approach, especially at decision making and planning stage. Modeling and optimization found widespread applications in the study of physical and chemical systems, production planning and scheduling systems, location and transportation problems, resource allocation in financial systems, and engineering design. This article reviews the literature on power and supply sector developments and analyzes the role of modeling and optimization in this sector as well as the future prospective of optimization modeling as a tool for sustainable energy systems.},

Formulation of an energy model will help in the proper allocation of widely available renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, bioenergy and small hydropower in meeting the future energy demand in India. During the last decade several new concepts of energy planning and management such as decentralized planning, energy conservation through improved technologies, waste recycling, integrated energy planning, introduction of renewable energy sources and energy forecasting have emerged. In this paper an attempt has been made to understand and review the various emerging issues related to the energy modeling. The different types of models such as energy planning models, energy supply–demand models, forecasting models, renewable energy models, emission reduction models, optimization models have been reviewed and presented.

Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making.},

The present work is carried out in the framework of the European {FP}-7 project {EVOL} (Evaluation and Viability Of Liquid fuel fast reactor system). One of the project tasks is to report on safety analyses: calculations of reactor transients using various numerical codes for the molten salt fast reactor ({MSFR}) under different boundary conditions, assumptions, and for different selected scenarios. Based on the original reference core geometry, an optimized geometry was proposed by Rouch et al. (2014. Ann. Nucl. Energy 64, 449) on thermal-hydraulic design aspects to avoid a recirculation zone near the blanket which accumulates heat and very high temperature exceeding the salt boiling point. Using both fully neutronics thermal-hydraulic coupled codes ({SIMMER} and {COUPLE}), we also re-confirm the efforts step by step toward a core geometry without the recirculation zone in particular as concerns the modifications of the core geometrical shape. Different transients namely Unprotected Loss of Heat Sink ({ULOHS}), Unprotected Loss of Flow ({ULOF}), Unprotected Transient Over Power ({UTOP}), Fuel Salt Over Cooling ({FSOC}) are intensively investigated and discussed with the optimized core geometry. It is demonstrated that due to inherent negative feedbacks, an {MSFR} plant has a high safety potential.},

This study establishes suitable calculation models for the neutronics analysis of the molten salt reactor and develops a new code named {MOREL} based on the three-dimensional diffusion steady and transient calculations. Some numerical tests are chosen to verify the code and the numerical results indicate that {MOREL} can be used for the analysis of the molten salt reactor. After verification, it is applied to analyze the characteristics of a typical molten salt reactor, including the steady characteristics, the influence of fuel circulation on the kinetic behaviors. Besides, the influence of online fuel reprocessing simulation is also examined.

Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s ({ORNL}) Molten Salt Reactor Experiment({MSRE}) is selected for the case study and the system of nuclear codes {DRAGON} and {ARCH} are used for lattice and core calculations respectively. {DRAGLIB}, an open-source group condensed cross-section library compatible with {DRAGON} is used for transport calculations. Differences in the reactivity values are observed using the two recent libraries namely, {JEFF} 3.1.2 and {ENDF}/{BVII}.1. A reactivity difference of about 4.5 mk, close to a typical beta value for the reactor, is observed for {MSRE} core using {ENDF}/{BVII}.1 and {JEFF}3.1.2 libraries. This is attributed to the absence of (n,2n) neutron multiplication reaction cross section for Beryllium in the processed {JEFF} 3.1.2 draglib library. The effect of missing (n,2n) cross-section leads to an underestimated net reactivity. Core calculations for the {MSRE} are found satisfactory and highlight observations regarding flux and power distribution which were not seen previously in {ORNL}’s calculations. A study on the reactivity coefficients reconfirm that the graphite temperature coefficient as calculated previously was overestimated due to lack of proper data library. The present paper aims to understand the {MSR} neutronics and validate numerical simulation methodology as well as benchmark the indigenously developed core code {ARCH} on molten salt systems. It also emphasizes the effect of beryllium as a neutron multiplier in the fluid fuel for typical {MSRs} and highlights its importance in the library evaluations and on the computational correctness of the reactivity of molten salt systems.},

	abstract = {The moderated Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) is an attractive breeder reactor. However, the temperature feedback coefficient of such a system can be positive due to the contribution of the moderator, an effect that can only be avoided with special measures. A previous study (Nagy et al., 2010) aimed to find a core design that is a breeder and has negative overall temperature feedback coefficient. In this paper, a coupled calculation scheme, which includes the reactor physics, heat transfer and fluid dynamics calculations is introduced. It is used both for steady-state and for dynamic calculations to evaluate the safety of the core design which was selected from the results of the previous study. The calculated feedback coefficients on the salt and graphite temperatures, power and uranium concentration prove that the core design derived in the previous optimization study is safe because the temperature feedback coefficient of the core and of the power is sufficiently negative. Transient calculations are performed to show the inherent safety of the reactor in case of reactivity insertion. As it is shown, the response of the reactor to these transients is initially dominated by the strong negative feedback of the salt.

Here, the tritium production in a 2 {MW} liquid-fueled molten salt experimental reactor ({TMSR}-{LF}1) was calculated by {ORIGEN}-S with an updated cross-section library generated by {TRITON} in {SCALE} 6.1.3 code system. The results show that the tritium production rate and normalized tritium production rate of {TMSR}-{LF}1 are 8.90 × 1011 Bq/day and 4.45 × 1011 Bq/({MW} day), respectively. The environmental impact of tritium was analyzed via {PC}-{CREAM} 08 with an assumed 36 \% release rate of tritium referring to the molten salt reactor experiment. During normal operations, the maximum tritium concentration is 1.4 Bq/m3 under normal condition, and the corresponding individual dose to the public is about 1 μSv/a; under extreme conditions, the maximum concentration and corresponding individual doses are 11.8 Bq/m3 and 9 μSv/a, respectively. Ingestion is the main exposure pathway and accounts for 62 \% of the total dose. Of this, 35 \% is from organically bound tritium.},

	abstract = {The quasi-static method is a standard tool for the space–time solution of neutron transport problems in multiplying media. Its basic principle lies in a factorization of the angular flux into the product of two functions, ‘amplitude’ and ‘shape’, where the amplitude depends only on time (and contains the major part of the time-dependence) while the shape function depends on all variables, time included. The shape equation is solved on a long time-scale, while the amplitude is determined on a short time-scale. The factorization is made unique by proper normalization conditions for the shape function. Most implementations replace the basic equation (transport or diffusion) by the set of coupled amplitude and shape equations derived from the factorization, the so-called ‘Improved Quasi-static Method’ ({IQM}). In this paper we describe an alternate approach already known for some time we have called ‘Predictor–Corrector Quasi-static Method’ ({PCQM}). We discuss its efficiency for both solid- and liquid-fuel systems dynamics.},

The present work developed a three dimensional neutronic/thermal-hydraulic coupled code investigated the neutronics and thermo-hydraulics characteristics of the core in transient condition based on neutron diffusion theory and numerical heat transfer. The code consists of two group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes and six group balance equations for delayed neutron precursors. The code was separately validated by neutron benchmark and flow and heat transfer benchmark. Three different transient conditions was analyzed with inlet temperature drop, reactivity jump and pump coastdown.

Energy’s Office of Nuclear Energy, thermal and fast spectrum molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) were
analyzed to assess performance of the reactor technology in various fuel cycles. These analyses
include fuel cycles with (1) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in fast
critical reactors, (2) continuous recycle of U/Pu with new natural uranium fuel in both fast and
thermal critical reactors, and (3) limited and continuous recycle of 233U/Th in thermal reactors.
For each analysis, the evolution of the fuel salt was simulated for several years, and the fuel cycle
metrics were calculated at the end of the simulation after equilibrium was achieved. Both thermal
and fast spectrum {MSRs} performed well in replacing other technologies. Fuel cycle metrics
highlight the impact of larger mass flow rates in {MSRs} due to their continuous treatment and
separations of the fuel salt material. Liquid-fueled {MSRs} also provide a benefit in transition due to
immediate availability of bred fissile material and low out-of-core time. Results from these
analyses provide confidence that {MSR} technologies achieve adequate neutronic performance and
may be used as an alternate reactor technology in the studied fuel cycles.},

The {MAC} calculates thermal-hydraulic parameters, namely temperature distribution, flow distribution and pressure drop. The {MCNP}4c performs the analysis of effective multiplication factor, neutron flux, power distribution and conversion ratio. In this work, the modification of core configuration is achieved by different core zoning and various fuel channel diameters, contributing to flat flux distribution. Specifically, the core is divided into two regions and the effects of different core zoning on the both neutronics and thermal-hydraulic behavior of moderated molten salt reactor are investigated. We conclude that the flat flux distribution cannot always guarantee better performance in thermal-hydraulic perspective and can decreases the graphite lifetime significantly.},

The method is derived by the application of factorization formulae for both the neutron density and the delayed precursor concentrations and the projection of the balance equations upon a weighting function. A physically meaningful weight can be assumed as the solution of the adjoint model, which is constructed for the situation considered, including delayed neutrons. The quasi-static scheme is then applied to calculations of some transients for a typical configuration of a molten-salt reactor, in a multigroup diffusion model with a one-dimensional slug-flow velocity field.

Particular attention is devoted to the description of the adopted time integration and physics coupling strategies. The proposed model features the adoption of an implicit Runge–Kutta scheme and the coupling among neutron diffusion, Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes equations for mass and momentum conservation, and energy and delayed neutron precursor balance equations, in order to accurately catch thermal feedbacks on neutronics. The solver is aimed at performing fast-running simulations of the full-core three-dimensional Molten Salt Fast Reactor geometry. The neutronics modelling is assessed against Monte Carlo simulations and the results of a simplified case study are compared to those from multiphysics tools previously developed. As an example of the capability of the model, an unprotected {MSFR} single pump failure accidental scenario is simulated and discussed. The main purpose of the present model is to serve as fast-running computational tool in the phase of design optimization of fuel loop components. More in general, it is of valuable help in the study of reactor physics of circulating-fuel systems.},

It was followed by a non-linear programming ({NLP}) formulation which combines the ‘bottom-up’ technology model with a ‘top-down’ simplified macro-economic model. In recent years, the family was enlarged by members to model material flows, to employ stochastic programming ({SP}) to address future uncertainties, to model endogenous technology learning using mixed integer programming ({MIP}) techniques, and to model multiple regions ({NLP}/{LP}).},

The former was applied to pseudo-binary fluoride systems to clarify the behaviors of cesium and iodine in the fluoride molten salt. The latter was applied to the mixture of {CsI} and {FLiNaK}. These experiments were carried out as the first step of the source term studies, so that interaction with air components has not been covered yet.

In particular, graphite-moderated reactors provide an appropriate case study for isotopics relevant in Pu production in a clandestine nuclear program due to the ease of design and low thermal output. We study the production characteristics of the X-10 reactor with a goal to develop statistically-relevant nuclear forensic signatures from early Pu production. In X-10 reactor, a flat flux gradient and low burnup produce exceptionally pure Pu as evident by the 240Pu/239Pu ratio. However, these design aspects also make determining reactor zone attribution, done with the 242Pu/240Pu ratio, uncertain. Alternatively, the same ratios produce statistically differentiable results between Manhattan Project and post-Manhattan Project reactor configurations, allowing for attribution conclusions.},

	abstract = {Simulation of Daily Load Follow Operation ({DLFO}) for a whole cycle has long computation time as well as tedious lengthy input files. The purpose of this study is to reduce the computation burden associated with long-term {DLFO} simulation by developing a Simplified Load Follow Scheme ({SLFS}) simulation that can reproduce the core characteristics of long-term {DLFO} simulation (reference scheme) at End of Cycle ({EOC}). To achieve this aim, the {SLFS} employs two constraints: energy production and cycle length must equal those of the reference scheme. The solution variables in a {SLFS} then becomes operation time and power level satisfying the two constraints. In this paper, low power levels of 50\%, 63\%, 75\%, and a maximum power level of 100\% are employed for the {SLFSs}. Operation times are determined to satisfy the two constraints for the given power level. The reference scheme in this paper employs {OPR}1000 Mode-K daily load follow scheme for the Small Modular Reactor ({SMR}). The results show the {SLFSs} can predict Core Radial Plane Burnup ({CRPB}) and Core Radial Plane Power ({CRPP}) distributions of a long-term {DLFO} with errors lower than 6\% across the core height. Axial Offset ({AO}) and Control Element Assembly ({CEA}) critical height of the {SLFSs} are also comparable with the reference scheme with low errors of 1.5\% and 4.5\% respectivelyat {EOC}. The computational time of the simplified schemes is reduced by more than 29 times than that of the reference scheme. Single Control Element Assembly ({SCEA}) Ejection is simulated to validate the applicability of the simplified schemes. The {SCEA} ejection simulations also show {CRPP} distribution errors less than 6\%. In conclusion, the {SLFSs} can be used to simulate long-term {DLFO} with marginal errors of less than 6\%.},

	abstract = {In this early 21st century, our societies have to face a tremendous and increasing energy need while mitigating the global climate change and preserving the environment. Addressing this challenge requires an energy transition from the current fossil energy-based system to a carbon-free energy production system, based on a relevant energy mix combining renewables and nuclear energy. However, such an energy transition will only occur if it is accepted by the population. Powerful and reliable tools, such as life cycle assessments ({LCA}), aiming at assessing the respective merits of the different energy mix for most of the environmental impact indicators are therefore mandatory for supporting a risk-informed decision-process at the societal level. Before studying the deployment of a given energy mix, a prerequisite is to perform {LCAs} on each of the components of the mix. This paper addresses two potential nuclear energy components: a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation {III} European Pressurized Reactors ({EPR}) and a nuclear fuel cycle based on the Generation {IV} Sodium Fast Reactors ({SFR}). The basis of this study relies on the previous work done on the current French nuclear fuel cycle using the bespoke {NELCAS} tool specifically developed for studying nuclear fuel cycle environmental impacts. Our study highlights that the {EPR} already brings a limited improvement to the current fuel cycle thanks to a higher efficiency of the energy transformation and a higher burn-up of the nuclear fuel (−20\% on most of the chosen indicators) whereas the introduction of the {GEN} {IV} fast reactors will bring a significant breakthrough by suppressing the current front-end of the fuel cycle thanks to the use of depleted uranium instead of natural enriched uranium (this leads to a decrease of the impact from 17\% on water consumption and withdrawal and up to 96\% on {SOx} emissions). The specific case of the radioactive waste is also studied, showing that only the partitioning and transmutation of the americium in the blanket fuel of the {SFR} can reduce the footprint of the geological disposal (saving up to a factor of 7 on the total repository volume). Having now at disposition five models (open fuel cycle, current French twice through fuel cycle, {EPR} twice through fuel cycle, multi-recycling {SFR} fuel cycle and at a longer term, multi-recycling {SFR} fuel cycle including americium transmutation), it is possible to model the environmental impact of any fuel cycle combining these technologies. In the next step, these models will be combined with those of other carbon-free energies (wind, solar, biomass…) in order to estimate the environmental impact of future energy mixes and also to analyze the impact on the way these scenarios are deployed (transition pathways).},

	abstract = {A novel methodology for modeling the dynamic exchange of resources among actors in the {CYCLUS} fuel cycle simulator is described. The methodology is comprised of an information gathering step, a bipartite-graph-based supply-demand matching step, and a trade execution step. Its implementation in {CYCLUS} allows the simulator to model generic fuel cycles, i.e., those in which the types of facilities and possible resource flows is not known a priori. The flow of resources at each time step is algorithmically determined based on facilities’ resource flow preferences. The dynamicsim of both the preference-based flows and quantity and quality constraints on those flows are demonstrated via two simple scenarios. The first scenario exemplifies situations in which actors’ preferences change over time and the second typifies situations in which quality-based constraints limit resource flow. This generic capability provides a sufficient framework and basis for the {CYCLUS} simulation engine to model complex, advanced fuel cycles. (author)},

	abstract = {Although the extensive introduction of {VRs} (variable renewables) will play an essential role to resolve energy and environmental issues in Japan after the Fukushima nuclear accident, its large-scale integration would pose a technical challenge in the grid management; as one of technical countermeasures, hydrogen storage receives much attention, as well as rechargeable battery, for controlling the intermittency of {VR} power output. For properly planning renewable energy policies, energy system modeling is important to quantify and qualitatively understand its potential benefits and impacts. This paper analyzes the optimal grid integration of large-scale {VRs} using hydrogen storage in Japan by developing a high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model. Simulation results suggest that the installation of hydrogen storage is promoted by both its cost reduction and {CO}2 regulation policy. In addition, hydrogen storage turns out to be suitable for storing {VR} energy in a long period of time. Finally, through a sensitivity analysis of rechargeable battery cost, hydrogen storage is economically competitive with rechargeable battery; the cost of both technologies should be more elaborately recognized for formulating effective energy policies to integrate massive {VRs} into the country's power system in an economical manner.},

	abstract = {This chapter investigates long-term energy and environmental strategies, employing a regionally disaggregated Dynamic New Earth 21 model (called {DNE}21) which allows us to derive a normative future image of energy systems through the comprehensive incorporation of forecasted future technologies. This integrated energy system model, explicitly considering the availability of advanced nuclear technologies such as nuclear fuel cycle and fast breeder reactors which can improve the usage efficiency of natural uranium resources, employs computational tools to evaluate the optimal global energy mix compatible with low atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations. Simulation results in the model indicate that massive {CO}2 mitigation targets can be achieved with the large-scale deployment of innovative technology, highlighting roles for nuclear, renewables, efficient use of fossil fuel, and carbon capture and storage ({CCS}). The results support the simultaneous pursuit of multiple technologies, rather than focusing merely on realistic technological options based on current perceptions. However, the validity about the expected role of nuclear energy for the future should be critically evaluated in the new technical and political contexts that exist after the Fukushima nuclear accident.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to assess comprehensively the technological measures for limiting {CO}2 concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and then to sketch concrete scenarios for the desirable future development of the global energy system over the next century. To facilitate the assessment, we developed a large-scale energy system model Dynamic New Earth 21 based on the New Earth 21 model. The Dynamic New Earth 21 model has been developed to cope with newly emerging research topics, such as an integrated assessment of climate change. This paper presents the latest numerical results of this model and its outlined descriptions. In the framework of this energy model, the world is divided into 10 regions so we can evaluate the differences in regional economic and geographical conditions. The model can assess the various technological options up to the year 2100, optimizing intertemporally the sum of the discounted total energy system costs. As specific technological options, the model takes into account the following categories of technologies: energy-saving in end-use sectors, efficiency improvement in energy conversion sectors, utilization of various less carbon-intensive energy resources, disposal and recycling of {CO}2 recovered in the energy systems, and innovative system technologies especially with respect to hydrogen use. The results of the study suggest that the {CO}2 problem cannot be easily settled by any single technological option, but they also suggest that if those options are reasonably combined with one another there is technological potential for {CO}2 emission reduction. For limiting atmospheric {CO}2 concentrations to less than 550ppm over the next century, the computed optimal {CO}2 emission trajectory indicates that relatively modest abatement actions are expected in the near future, implying that immediate {CO}2 emission reduction or stabilization strategies will not necessarily lead to economically efficient outcomes.},

Introducing a strong decarbonisation constraint, for instance, profoundly modifies the power sector, which is impacted by increasing shares of variable renewable energy sources. Long-term modelling tools working on different assumptions increasingly factor in these impacts, the assessment of which requires a clear description and categorization of the technical and economic choices for representing the tools in question. A new typology based on a literature review is presented for both power sector models and long-term models of the energy system. New comparing criteria focussing on the power sector's components are put forward, such as electricity storage and grid. An analysis carried out by means of this categorization on five chosen models shows that, up until now, energy modelling tools and power system tools have been designed to meet separate objectives and have not combined their advantages.},

The model study suggests some insights regarding the question as to what combination of measures would be the cost-minimal technological responses to the global warming issue. While considerable uncertainties remain about the various assumptions made for the model analyses, the following items are identified. (1) Our energy system would still be dependent on fossil fuels over the next century, even with the regulation of {CO}2 concentration. (2) A cautious assessment of the results would conclude that the {CO}2 problem cannot be easily settled by any single technological option considered here. However, the energy model indicates that if all types of technological options are reasonably integrated with one another, a significant {CO}2 emission reduction potential exists to limit atmospheric {CO}2 concentration to 550ppm by the end of the 21st century. (3) The optimal {CO}2 emission trajectory to stabilize atmospheric {CO}2 concentration indicates that relatively modest abatement actions are expected, especially in the near future, allowing global {CO}2 emissions to continue to rise until around the middle of the 21st century. This is not to say that nothing needs to be done for the time being to reduce {CO}2 emissions.

Beginning with the deregulation of the retail electricity market, discussions have been initiated about Japanese electricity system reforms towards 2020. This paper examines the potential energy mix up to 2030 at the regional level, and identifies the need to accelerate electricity system reforms to expand the transregional access to renewable electricity generation. By analysing available data, we assess how regional renewable energy potentials can be put to effective use, and identify how electricity reform should proceed, to both capitalise on renewables and reduce carbon intensity. Finally, we report the large renewable potentials in Japan. However, in order to maximise the use of these potentials, a combination of technologies and policies are required to promote flexible grid operation, and strengthen transmission capacity and renewable priority dispatch order, as well as to introduce technology for stabilizing electricity systems supplied by renewable electricity, such as pumped storage hydropower, storage cells, and demand-response, which can store surplus energy until it is needed.},

	abstract = {Argonne has developed {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 models for the benchmark analyses of the Experimental Breeder Reactor {II} ({EBR}-{II}) Balance-of-Plant ({BOP}) tests that represented protected and unprotected loss of heat sink conditions. Some assumptions had to be made for the models because of uncertainties related to the cooling system. In addition, the reactivity feedback coefficients also have uncertainties due to the nuclear data. These uncertainties may contribute to discrepancies observed between the simulation results and the measured data. The objective of this study is to apply the recently developed coupling between Dakota and {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 to investigate the impact of uncertainties on the simulation results. The sensitivity analysis helps determine the prioritization of future R\&D efforts. Dakota is an uncertainty quantification and optimization toolkit. It was coupled with {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 via a Python interface to meet an increased need to perform sensitivity analyses and uncertainty quantification in the advanced reactor domain. Dakota was used to sample user-specified parameters, drive {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 transient simulations, and quantify statistical metrics as part of post processing. The studies described in this paper include the uncertainty quantification of the {EBR}-{II} simulations and calibration between the simulation results and the experimental data. By applying Dakota for uncertainty propagation, it is found that the radial expansion, control rod drive expansion, and stagnant sodium mixing models have significant impacts on the benchmark results. Following the uncertainty quantification, parameters in the {EBR}-{II} model that were identified to have significant impacts were optimized by Dakota in order to assess the magnitude of changes needed to improve the simulation results.},

	abstract = {The {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 computer code is developed by Argonne National Laboratory for thermal, hydraulic, and neutronic analysis of power and flow transients in liquidmetal- cooled nuclear reactors ({LMRs}). {SAS}4A was developed to analyze severe core disruption accidents with coolant boiling and fuel melting and relocation, initiated by a very low probability coincidence of an accident precursor and failure of one or more safety systems. {SASSYS}-1, originally developed to address loss-of-decay-heat-removal accidents, has evolved into a tool for margin assessment in design basis accident ({DBA}) analysis and for consequence assessment in beyond-design-basis accident ({BDBA}) analysis. {SAS}4A contains detailed, mechanistic models of transient thermal, hydraulic, neutronic, and mechanical phenomena to describe the response of the reactor core, its coolant, fuel elements, and structural members to accident conditions. The core channel models in {SAS}4A provide the capability to analyze the initial phase of core disruptive accidents, through coolant heat-up and boiling, fuel element failure, and fuel melting and relocation. Originally developed to analyze oxide fuel clad with stainless steel, the models in {SAS}4A have been extended and specialized to metallic fuel with advanced alloy cladding. {SASSYS}-1 provides the capability to perform a detailed thermal/hydraulic simulation of the primary and secondary sodium coolant circuits and the balance-ofplant steam/water circuit. These sodium and steam circuit models include component models for heat exchangers, pumps, valves, turbines, and condensers, and thermal/hydraulic models of pipes and plena. {SASSYS}-1 also contains a plant protection and control system modeling capability, which provides digital representations of reactor, pump, and valve controllers and their response to input signal changes.},

	abstract = {As one of the six Generation-{IV} reactors, {SFR} (sodium-cooled fast reactor) is attracting more and more attention in recent years. To evaluate the {SFR} safety characteristics, the Shutdown Heat Removal Tests ({SHRT}) conducted by Argonne National Laboratory ({ANL}) were performed in Experimental Breeder Reactor-{II} ({EBR}-{II}) to verify inhere safety characteristics. To find the inaccuracies in the exist models and improve the simulating level for {SFR}, {SHRT}-17 and {SHRT}-45R have been chosen as the benchmark problems for the {IAEA} coordinated research project ({CRP}), which we have participated in. {THACS} (the Transient Thermal-Hydraulic Code for Analysis of Sodium Cooled Fast Reactor) developed by {XJTU} was used in our work. {THACS} has finished preliminary with completion of all the models of primary loop originally intended for simulating accidents in {SFRs}. {THACS} is a multi-channel, multi-phase, multi-component transient and universal code coupled with the point reactor kinetics model. In this paper the models of {THACS} were introduced in detail and {SHRT} scenario simulation work of {EBR}-{II} has been performed. {THACS} was verified with the simulation results of flowrate and temperatures in core and instrumented subassembly {XX}09. After the verification, the peak coolant, cladding and fuel temperatures were estimated which is under the safety limits. Results show that {EBR}-{II} is effective in protecting the reactor against the severe loss-of-flow accidents. The three-layer model for cold pool coupled with {THACS} was used and the predicted results in a better agreement with the measurements.},

	abstract = {In the control field, the study of the system dynamics is usually carried out relying on lumped-parameter or one-dimensional modelling. Even if these approaches are well suited for control purposes since they provide fast-running simulations and are easy to linearize, they may not be sufficient to deeply assess the complexity of the systems, in particular where spatial phenomena have a significant impact on dynamics. Reduced Order Methods ({ROM}) can offer the proper trade-off between computational cost and solution accuracy. In this work, a reduced order model for the spatial description of the Gen-{IV} {LFR} coolant pool is developed for the purpose of being employed in a control-oriented plant simulator of the {ALFRED} reactor. The spatial modelling of the reactor pool is based on the {POD}-{FV}-{ROM} procedure, previously developed with the aim of extending the literature approach based on Finite Element to the Finite Volume approximation of the Navier-Stokes equations, and building a reduced order model capable of handling turbulent flows modelled through the {RANS} equations. The mentioned approach is employed to build a {ROM}-based component of the {ALFRED} simulator for the coolant pool. The possibility of varying the input variables of the model has been also undertaken. In particular, the lead velocity at the Steam Generator outlet has been considered as a parametrized boundary condition since it can be a possible control variable. The results have turned out to be very satisfactory in terms of both accuracy and computational time. As a major outcome of the {ROM} model, it has been proved that its behaviour is more accurate than a 0D-based model without requiring an excessive computational cost.},

	abstract = {Sodium cooled fast reactors have been developed in France for nearly 50 years with successively Rapsodie, Phenix and Superphenix plants. Thermal hydraulic challenges have progressively increased with the power and the size of the reactors. After Superphenix stop in 1997, the thermal hydraulic activity on sodium cooled fast reactors was drastically reduced for about 10 years. Nowadays, the so-called Astrid prototype developed in France in the frame of Generation {IV} deployment requires thermal hydraulic inputs to support the design and safety studies. This paper aims at summarizing the main thermal hydraulic challenges in sodium cooled fast reactors, on the basis of the past experience. Numerical and experimental tools used in the French Atomic Energy Commission ({CEA}) are briefly presented. The improvement on numerical simulation is emphasized with some examples of recent computations. Of course, this review is not a comprehensive one as it is mainly based on the author experience. The items covered in this paper are the subassembly, the core, the upper plenum, the lower plenum, the decay heat removal, the gas entrainment and the piping. Heat exchanger thermal hydraulics is also briefly mentioned. Several experimental and computed results are presented as simple illustrations without quantitative information on the data.},

It can be a component of the academic research methods used to produce research results, or it may itself be an academic research result. Software, however, has rarely been considered to be a citable artifact in its own right. With the advent of open-source software, artifact evaluation committees of conferences, and journals that include source code and running systems as part of the published artifacts, we foresee that software will increasingly be recognized as part of the academic process. The quality and sustainability of this software must be accounted for, both a priori and a posteriori.

The Dagstuhl Perspectives Workshop on “Engineering Academic Software” has examined the strengths, weaknesses, risks, and opportunities of academic software engineering. A key outcome of the workshop is this Dagstuhl Manifesto, serving as a roadmap towards future professional software engineering for software-based research instruments and other software produced and used in an academic context. The manifesto is expressed in terms of a series of actionable “pledges” that users and developers of academic research software can take as concrete steps towards improving the environment in which that software is produced.},

	abstract = {Prices in U.S. electricity markets fell precipitously in recent years, driving several nuclear power plants to announce plans to close well before the end of their licensed operation. Several more plants may soon follow suit. Stagnant demand for electricity, the growth of subsidized wind power, and cheap natural gas are variously blamed for driving down electricity prices and thus revenues for nuclear generators. This paper provides the first empirical estimate of the geographically heterogeneous impact of each of these three factors on the decline in market prices earned by nuclear plants in the {PJM} Interconnection over the period 2008 to 2016.},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions from biomass combustion are traditionally assumed climate neutral if the bioenergy system is carbon (C) flux neutral, i.e. the {CO}2 released from biofuel combustion approximately equals the amount of {CO}2 sequestered in biomass. This convention, widely adopted in life cycle assessment ({LCA}) studies of bioenergy systems, underestimates the climate impact of bioenergy. Besides {CO}2 emissions from permanent C losses, {CO}2 emissions from C flux neutral systems (that is from temporary C losses) also contribute to climate change: before being captured by biomass regrowth, {CO}2 molecules spend time in the atmosphere and contribute to global warming. In this paper, a method to estimate the climate impact of {CO}2 emissions from biomass combustion is proposed. Our method uses {CO}2 impulse response functions ({IRF}) from C cycle models in the elaboration of atmospheric decay functions for biomass-derived {CO}2 emissions. Their contributions to global warming are then quantified with a unit-based index, the {GWPbio}. Since this index is expressed as a function of the rotation period of the biomass, our results can be applied to {CO}2 emissions from combustion of all the different biomass species, from annual row crops to slower growing boreal forest.},

	shorttitle = {Moltres},
	abstract = {Moltres is a physics application for multiphysics modeling of fluid-fueled molten salt reactors
({MSRs}) (Lindsay et al. 2018). It couples equations for neutron diffusion, thermal
hydraulics, and delayed neutron precursor transport. Neutron diffusion and precursor
transport equations are set-up using an action system that allows the user to use an arbitrary
number of neutron energy and precursor groups respectively with minimal input
changes. Moltres sits on top of the Multi-physics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment
(Gaston et al. 2015) and hence uses the finite element method to discretize the
governing partial differential equations. In general the resulting system of non-linear algebraic
equations is linearized using the Newton-Raphson method and then solved using
the Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation (Balay et al. 2017). Assembly
of the Jacobian and residual, and the linear solve are parallelized using {MPI} which
allows Moltres to be run in massively parallel environments. Runs on the Blue Waters
supercomputer at Illinois have utilized up to 608 cores.
Moltres and {MOOSE} allow use of different basis functions for different system variables.
Because of the purely diffusive nature of the neutron diffusion equations, neutron fluxes are
typically discretized using continuous first-degree Lagrange polynomials and the degrees of
freedom are associated with mesh nodes. The temperature variable may also be discretized
with a continuous Lagrange basis, or a discontinuous basis of arbitrary degree monomials
may be employed depending on the relative balance of heat convection to conduction. The
purely hyperbolic precursor transport is currently discretized using constant monomials,
which is equivalent to a first-order finite volume discretization. Moltres supports both
segregated (through Picard iteration) and monolithic solutions of the equation system.
However, due to the feedback between the power spectrum and temperature dependence
of macroscopic cross-sections, monolithic solves have demonstrated superior robustness
with segregated techniques often unable to converge to a solution. This result emphasizes
the importance of a fully coupled multi-physics framework like the one that Moltres and
{MOOSE} provide and suggests that iteratively coupling codes devoted to single physics
(Kópházi, Lathouwers, and Kloosterman 2009) may result in limited flexibility.},

Variability issues that concern many are not unique to variable renewables. Grid operators have been dealing with demand variability for over a century. With sufficiently accurate forecast for variable renewables, the grid operators can schedule dispatchable generation and/or storage resources to balance demand and supply on a nearly real-time basis. With state-of-the-art wind forecasting technologies and existing generation resources, wind integration has not caused major operational problems for grid systems with a penetration level of up to 37\% during some time intervals. Base load generators operate nearly constantly for days or longer and supply a larger share of the electricity mix than what is proportional to their capacity. This will be a limiting factor for high level variable renewables, if current operation continues. The capability to at least partially follow electricity load should be a key performance measure of non-renewable plants if we are serious about high level variable renewables. Specific policy instruments are recommended to incentivize more flexible plant operation and ensure smooth integration of variable renewables.},

Two thorium fuel strategies were analyzed: a homogeneous and a heterogeneous mixture of 232Th were set in the European Lead-cooled Fast Reactor core model. For this, the Monte Carlo Serpent-2.27 code and the {JEFF}-3.1 cross section library were used to perform the calculations. Three neutronic parameters were analyzed for each fuel strategy: the effective neutron multiplication factor (keff) for a cycle of 900 days, the Doppler constant and the reactivity effect of coolant density. With the homogeneous mixture of 232Th the neutron multiplication factor increases during the whole operating cycle (900 days), allowing a longer fuel cycle, keeping negative values for the Doppler constant and the reactivity effect of coolant density, with −692 pcm and −148 pcm, respectively. On the other hand, the addition of 232Th heterogeneously in the core showed that there is the necessity to have a reactivity excess around 2.2\% Δk to fulfill the same fuel operating cycle. Even when there is a {ThO}2 blanket zone, the 233U production is not enough to increase the keff value and to enlarge the fuel operating cycle. Otherwise, the Doppler constant and the reactivity effect of coolant density are also negative values.},

These estimates are currently generated using dose models prescribed for the commercial nuclear power industry by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ({NRC}), The {NRC} provides default values for dose-model parameters for facilities without resources to develop sitespecific values. A survey of land- and water-use characteristics for the Savannah River area has been conducted to determine site-specific values for water recreation, consumption, and agricultural parameters used in the {NRC} Regulatory Guide 1.109 (1977) dosimetric models. These site parameters include local characteristics of meat, milk, and vegetable production; recreational and commercial activities on the Savannah River; and meat, milk, vegetable, and seafood consumption rates. This paper describes how parameter data were obtained at the Savannah River Site and the impacts of such data on off-site dose. Dose estimates using site-specific parameter values are compared to estimates using the {NRC} default values.

This paper discusses four most potential nuclear fuel cycle modes in China and analyzes the natural uranium requirements under these different fuel cycle modes first based on three development patterns (low-, medium-, and high-speed) of installed nuclear power capacity. Then, an optimization model including natural uranium requirements, spent fuel final disposal amounts and total cost of electricity generation is constructed and optimization problem under two scenarios of reprocessing capacity are solved and results discussed. The annual and cumulative natural uranium requirements under these two scenarios are also calculated. Finally some conclusions are put forward based on the analyses.},

The Economic Modeling Working Group of {GIF} developed an Excel based spreadsheet package, G4ECONS (Generation 4 Excel-based Calculation Of Nuclear Systems), to calculate the total capital investment cost ({TCIC}) and the levelised unit energy cost ({LUEC}). G4ECONS is sufficiently generic in the sense that it can accept the types of projected input, performance and cost data that are expected to become available for Generation {IV} systems through various development phases and that it can model both open and closed fuel cycles. The Nuclear Energy System Assessment ({NESA}) Economic Support Tool ({NEST}) was developed to enable an economic analysis using the {INPRO} methodology to easily calculate outputs including the {TCIC}, {LUEC} and other financial figures of merit including internal rate of return, return of investment and net present value. {NEST} is also Excel based and can be used to evaluate nuclear reactor systems using the open fuel cycle, {MOX} (mixed oxide) fuel recycling and closed cycles. A Super Critical Water-cooled Reactor system with an open fuel cycle and two Fast Reactor systems, one with a break-even fuel cycle and another with a burner fuel cycle, were selected for the benchmarking exercise. Published data on capital and operating costs were used for economics analyses using G4ECONS and {NEST} tools. Both G4ECONS and {NEST} predicted comparable {TCIC} and {LUEC}; with some variation in fuel cycle costs. The benchmarking exercise was also useful to understand the differences in the two methodologies for potential harmonisation opportunities in the future.},

	abstract = {The ability to model and simulate nuclear reactors during steady state and transient conditions is important for designing efficient and safe nuclear power systems. The accurate simulation of a nuclear reactor is particularly challenging because the multiple physical processes within the reactor are tightly coupled, which requires that the numerical methods used to resolve each physical process can accurately and efficiently transfer and utilize data from other applications. Monte Carlo methods are desirable for solving the neutron transport equation required in reactor analysis because of the inherent accuracy of the method, but the Computational Solid Geometry ({CSG}) representation of the physical geometry makes it difficult to accurately and efficiently perform multiphysics reactor analyses with other applications that utilize finite element or finite volume representations. To address this limitation, a multiphysics coupling framework that minimizes the need for spatial discretization in the Monte Carlo geometry is presented in this thesis. The coupling framework uses Functional Expansion Tallies to transfer multiphysics information from the Monte Carlo application to other multiphysics tools. Additionally, the coupling framework uses a modified method for transporting neutrons through spatially continuous total macroscopic cross section distributions in order to incorporate continuous multiphysics feedback fields such as fuel temperature and coolant density into the Monte Carlo simulation. It has been shown that separable Zernike and Legendre Function Expansion Tallies can effectively reconstruct a continuous distribution of fission power density. Additionally, using a prototypical three-dimensional Light Water Reactor pin cell, the method used to transport neutrons through a continuously varying fuel temperature and coolant density distribution was shown to be 1.7 times faster than a comparable discretized simulation with volume-averaged properties, while still providing a high level of accuracy. Finally, in order to make the overall multiphysics coupling scheme useful for reactor analyses, a novel spatially continuous depletion methodology was developed and investigated. With the spatially continuous depletion methodology, number densities can be represented as a linear combination of polynomials, and those polynomial representations can be integrated through time to predict reactor operation. The spatially continuous depletion methodology was able to accurately predict the eigenvalue and number density distributions in a two-dimensional {LWR} pin cell depletion containing Gd-157 from a 2 weight percent {GdO}2 and seven other nuclides in the depletion matrix. Analyses of the spatially continuous depletion methodology showed that significant reductions in the number of tallied values could be achieved if polynomial representations were optimized for each nuclide reaction rate. From the depletion simulations in this thesis, a 23\% reduction in the required number of reaction rate tallies compared to a lower-fidelity, 10 radial ring pin discretization was shown to be achievable with nuclide polynomial optimization. In addition to showing potential for reductions in tally memory and computational requirements, the spatially continuous depletion simulation was shown to be equal in computational performance to a discrete simulation with 10 radial rings and 8 azimuthal cuts, while providing a much higher level of spatial fidelity in number density concentrations.},

	abstract = {As discovered during the Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) Experiment ({MSRE}), selected fission products deposited on the wetted surfaces throughout the reactor. Fission products such as molybdenum and ruthenium are noble with respect to the electrochemical potential of the fluoride fuel salt and therefore remain insoluble in their elemental forms rather than becoming ionic salts. Coalescing in the primary fluid, these noble metals then migrate and eventually deposit on internal reactor surfaces. Since the bulk of these noble metal fission products are also energetically unstable they bring not only physical fouling, but heat and radiation from decay as well. The adherence forces of five of the seven principal radioactive foulants discovered during the {MSRE} were measured on six different potential structural materials by atomic force microscope force spectroscopy ({AFM}-{FS}). The noble metals studied were niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, antimony and tellurium. Structural materials measured were Hastelloy-N, the primary structural metal of the {MSRE}; two steels, {SS}316L and F91; commercially pure nickel and molybdenum; and silicon carbide. {MSRs} operate with surfaces free of passivating corrosion layers, so the measurements were conducted on bare metal surfaces. An argon ion gun chamber was constructed for removal of the oxide layers from mechanically polished substrate metals by sputtering. A combination vacuum chamber/glove box was crafted to accept the sputter polished substrates into a dry, inert environment where the force adhesion measurements were made. Data acquired in the last phase of the study partially demonstrated the concept. The measured particle-to-substrate attractive forces found antimony and tellurium to be generally more adherent to the bare metals than niobium or molybdenum. The finding is consistent with the fouling examined in the {MSRE}. If held, this correlation of laboratory measurement to actual fouling may aid the reactor designer in anticipating fouling to plan for the effects. Such knowledge would inform selection of plant materials, both for operating components such as flow detectors and heat exchangers, where fission product deposition would be undesired, and for processing components such as filters and metal collection systems, where adhesion would be preferred.},

	abstract = {Several options for designing fast reactors to operate in the Breed-and-Burn (B\&B) mode are compared and a strategy is outlined for early introduction of B\&B reactors followed by a gradual increase in the fuel utilization of such reactors. In the first phase the fast reactor core will consist of a subcritical B\&B blanket driven by a relatively small critical seed. As the required discharge burnup/radiation-damage to both driver and blanket fuel had already been proven, and as the depleted uranium fueled B\&B blanket could generate close to 2/3 of the core power and will have very low fuel cycle cost, the deployment of such fast reactors could start in the near future. The second phase consists of deploying self-sustaining stationary wave B\&B reactors. It will require development of fuel technology that could withstand peak burnups of {\textasciitilde}30\% and peak radiation damage to the cladding of {\textasciitilde}550 dpa. The third phase requires development of a fuel reconditioning technology that will enable using the fuel up to an average burnup of {\textasciitilde}50\%—the upper bound permitted by neutron balance considerations when most of the fission products are not separated from the fuel. The increase in the uranium ore utilization relative to that provided by contemporary power reactors is estimated to be 20, 40 and 100 folds for, respectively, phase 1, 2 and 3. The energy value of the depleted uranium stockpiles (“waste”) accumulated in the {US} is equivalent to, when used in the B\&B reactors, up to 20 centuries of the total 2010 {USA} supply of electricity. Therefore, a successful development of B\&B reactors could provide a great measure of energy sustainability and cost stability.},

It is expected that Asian countries continue growing their economy and will result consuming more energy. More {CO}2 emission is not acceptable. Nuclear power has many advantages for reducing {CO}2 emission. However, it still has concerns of nuclear proliferation, radioactive waste and safety. It is necessary to overcome these concerns if nuclear power is expanded to Asian countries. Thorium utilization as nuclear fuel will be an opening key of these difficulties because thorium produces less plutonium, less radioactive waste. Safety will also be enhanced. The use of molten-salt reactor ({MSR}) triggered by plutonium supply from ordinary light water reactor ({LWR}) with uranium fuel will allow implementation of thorium fuel cycle with electricity capacity of about 446 {GWe} around at 2050. The other important sector in a view of sustainability is transportation. Transportation is essential for economy growth. Therefore it is inevitable to reduce {CO}2 emission from transportation sector. Electric vehicle ({EV}) will be used as a major mobility instead of gasoline engine cars. Rare-earth materials such as neodymium and dysprosium are necessary for producing {EV}. These materials are expected to be mined from Asian countries. It is often obtained with thorium as by-product. Thorium has not been used as nuclear fuel because it is not good for nuclear weapon and it does not have fissionable isotopes. Recent global trend of nuclear disarmament and accumulation of plutonium from uranium fuel cycle can support starting the use of thorium. Thorium utilization will help both to provide clean energy and to produce rare-earth for clean vehicle. These will create new industries in developing Asian countries. An international collaborative framework can be established by supplying resource from developing countries and supplying technology from developed countries. “{THE} Bank ({THorium} Energy Bank)” is proposed here as one part of such a framework.},

Thus, it is necessary to discuss the role of nuclear power from the viewpoint of this definition. The history of nuclear power has been the control of the nuclear fission reaction. Once this is obtained, then the economy of the system is required. On the other hand, it is also necessary to consider the internalization of the external diseconomy to avoid damage to human society caused by the economic activity itself, due to its limited capacity. An extreme example is waste. Thus, reducing radioactive waste resulting from nuclear power is essential. Nuclear non-proliferation must be guaranteed. Moreover, the {FUKUSHIMA} accident revealed that it is still not enough that human beings control nuclear reaction. Further, the most essential issue for sustaining use of one technology is human resources in manufacturing, operation, policy-making and education. Nuclear power will be able to satisfy the requirements of sustainability only when these subjects are addressed.

	abstract = {As part of a nuclear fuel cycle evaluation and screening (E\&S) study, widely ranging thorium fuel cycle options were evaluated, and their performance characteristics and challenges to implementation were compared to those of other nuclear fuel cycle options based on criteria specified by the Nuclear Energy Office of the U.S. Department of Energy. The evaluated nuclear fuel cycles included the once-through, limited, and continuous recycle options using critical or externally driven nuclear energy systems. The E\&S study found that the continuous recycle of 233U/Th in fuel cycles using either thermal or fast reactors is an attractive promising fuel cycle option with high effective fuel resource utilization and low waste generation, but they did not perform quite as well as the continuous recycle of Pu/U using a fast critical system, which was identified as one of the most promising fuel cycle options in the E\&S study. This is because compared to their uranium counterparts, the thorium-based systems tended to have higher radioactivity in the short term ( 100 years postirradiation), because of differences in the fission product yield curves, and in the long term (100 000 years postirradiation), because of the decay of 233U and daughters, and because of higher mass flow rates due to lower discharge burnups. Some of the thorium-based systems also require enriched uranium support, which tends to be detrimental to resource utilization and waste generation metrics. Finally, similar to the need to develop recycle fuel fabrication, fuels separations, and fast reactors for the most promising options using Pu/U recycle, the future thorium-based fuel cycle options with continuous recycle would also require such capabilities; however, their deployment challenges are expected to be greater since past development of such facilities has not reached a comparable level of maturity.},

A consistent approach for calculating the radiotoxicity is established for four oxide fuel types in a pressurized water reactor: low-enrichment uranium, uranium with plutonium fissile material, thorium with 233U fissile material, and thorium with plutonium fissile material. The results of the calculations are presented to display the radiotoxicity trends and are analyzed to determine (a) what underlies the indicated radiotoxicity trends for decay times from 1 year to 20 million years and (b) factors that may have led to erroneous conclusions concerning the comparative radiotoxicity of thorium- and uranium-based fuels. The overall conclusion is that the ingestion radiotoxicity of thorium-based fuels containing 233U or plutonium fissile materials is similar to the radiotoxicity of uranium-based fuels containing 235U or plutonium fissile materials but that within this overall similarity there are significant differences in radiotoxicity in specific eras during decay.},

	abstract = {Thorium-based nuclear fuel cycles have received renewed attention in both research and public circles since about the year 2000. Much of the attention has been focused on nuclear fission energy production that utilizes thorium as a fertile element for producing fissionable 233U for recycle in thermal reactors, fast reactors, or externally driven systems. Lesser attention has been paid to other fuel cycle operations that are necessary for implementation of a sustainable thorium-based fuel cycle such as reprocessing and fabrication of recycle fuels containing 233U.This paper first identifies recent literature that has resulted from the renewed interest in thorium-based fuel cycles. Next, differences in the radiation characteristics of nuclear materials associated with thorium-based and uranium-based fuels are discussed, and the generic implications of the differences to nuclear material processing are identified. Then, experience at Oak Ridge National Laboratory concerning processing of thorium and 233U is described in terms of the processing projects and campaigns undertaken and the facilities in which the processing was implemented. This experience then provides the basis for a generalized discussion of processing nuclear materials associated with thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles.This comparative discussion focuses on key out-of-reactor fuel cycle operations: reprocessing of metal-clad oxide and graphite-matrix oxide used nuclear fuels ({UNFs}) including head-end processing (shearing and dissolution), solvent extraction, product conversion, fuel fabrication, and waste management. It is concluded that the recycle of thorium-based {UNF} constituents (233U and thorium) is more technically challenging than the recycle of uranium-based {UNF} constituents (plutonium and uranium) based on the radiation, chemical, and physical characteristics of nuclear materials in thorium-based fuel cycles as compared to uranium-based fuel cycles.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) systems are liquid-fueled reactors that can be used for actinide burning, production of electricity, production of hydrogen, and production of ssile fuels (breeding). Thorium (Th) and uranium-233 (233 U) are fertile and ssile of the {MSR} systems, and dissolved in a high-temperature molten fluoride salt (fuel salt) with a very high boiling temperature (up to 1650K), that is both the reactor nuclear fuel and the coolant. The {MSR} system is one of the six advanced reactor concepts identified by the Generation {IV} International Forum ({GIF}) as a candidate for cooperative development [1]. In the {MSR} system, fuel salt flows through a fuel duct constructed around a reactor core and fuel channel of a graphite moderator accompanied by fission reaction and heat generation, and flows out to an external-loop system consisted of a heat exchanger and a circulation pump. Due to the motion of fuel salt, delayed neutron precursors that are one of the source of neutron production make to change their position between the ssion reaction and neutron emission events and decay even occur in the external loop system. Hence the reactivity and effective delayed neutron precursor fraction of the {MSR} system are lower than those of solid fuel reactor systems such as Boiling Water Reactors ({BWRs}) and Pressurised Water Reactor ({PWRs}). Since all of the presently operating nuclear power reactors utilize solid fuel, little attention had been paid to the {MSR} analysis of the reactivity loss and reactor characteristics change caused by the fuel salt circulation. Sides et al. [2] and Shimazu et al. [3] developed {MSR} analytical models based on the point reactor kinetics model to consider the effect of fuel salt flow. Their models represented a reactor as having six zones for fuel salt and three zones for the graphite moderator. Since their models employed the point reactor kinetics model and the rough temperature approximation, their results were not sufficiently accurate to consider the effect of fuel salt flow.},

This flexibility has been utilized for the conception of different possibilities for the closure of the thorium fuel cycle. The easiest scheme is mixed-oxide recycling with repeated recycling of 236U. Loading recycle fuel into separate elements without thorium reduces the uranium ore demand by 13\%. Entire separation of the feed and breed circuits brings another reduction of 5\%. Furthermore, the feed-breed cycle allows the production of 233U for the near-breeder variant. This variant achieves a conversion ratio of 0.97, and it represents a possible choice for efficient protection of uranium ore resources. Within the span of uncertainties in the cost assumptions, fuel cycle costs are found to be comparable for all considered cycles, including the near-breeder.},

	url = {http://www.doria.fi/handle/10024/120858},
	abstract = {Increasing amount of renewable energy source based electricity production has set high load control requirements for power grid balance markets. The essential grid balance between electricity consumption and generation is currently hard to achieve economically with new-generation solutions. Therefore conventional combustion power generation will be examined in this thesis as a solution to the foregoing issue. Circulating fluidized bed ({CFB}) technology is known to have sufficient scale to acts as a large grid balancing unit. Although the load change rate of the {CFB} unit is known to be moderately high, supplementary repowering solution will be evaluated in this thesis for load change maximization. The repowering heat duty is delivered to the {CFB} feed water preheating section by smaller gas turbine ({GT}) unit. Consequently, steam extraction preheating may be decreased and large amount of the gas turbine exhaust heat may be utilized in the {CFB} process to reach maximum plant electrical efficiency. Earlier study of the repowering has focused on the efficiency improvements and retrofitting to maximize plant electrical output. This study however presents the {CFB} load change improvement possibilities achieved with supplementary {GT} heat. The repowering study is prefaced with literature and theory review for both of the processes to maximize accuracy of the research. Both dynamic and steady-state simulations accomplished with {APROS} simulation tool will be used to evaluate repowering effects to the {CFB} unit operation. Eventually, a conceptual level analysis is completed to compare repowered plant performance to the state-of-the-art {CFB} performance. Based on the performed simulations, considerably good improvements to the {CFB} process parameters are achieved with repowering. Consequently, the results show possibilities to higher ramp rate values achieved with repowered {CFB} technology. This enables better plant suitability to the grid balance markets.},

This can be seen in reactor analysis where analysts are interested in coupled flow, heat transfer and neutronics, and in fuel performance simulation where analysts are interested in thermomechanics with contact coupled to species transport and chemistry. These more ambitious simulations usually motivate some level of parallel computing. Many of the coupling efforts to date utilize simple code coupling or first-order operator splitting, often referred to as loose coupling. While these approaches can produce answers, they usually leave questions of accuracy and stability unanswered. Additionally, the different physics often reside on separate grids which are coupled via simple interpolation, again leaving open questions of stability and accuracy. Utilizing state of the art mathematics and software development techniques we are deploying next generation tools for nuclear engineering applications. The Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov ({JFNK}) method combined with physics-based preconditioning provide the underlying mathematical structure for our tools. {JFNK} is understood to be a modern multiphysics algorithm, but we are also utilizing its unique properties as a scale bridging algorithm. To facilitate rapid development of multiphysics applications we have developed the Multiphysics Object-Oriented Simulation Environment ({MOOSE}).

A simulation-based approach is strongly needed for such a purpose. In this paper, the current major trends are reviewed on research activities related to smart energy systems. First, a bibliometric analysis of academic papers was conducted with the aim of visualizing clusters that indicate the hot topics attributable to smart energy systems. Considering the extracted research topics and representative references that are the core of each cluster, possible simulation-based approaches for the design of smart energy system are schematically structured on the basis of social, economic, and technological aspects. Through this study, the framework needed for the design of smart energy systems is characterized with simulation-based socioeconomic and technological analyses.},

Its design philosophy emphasizes radioactive waste removal, nonproliferation, and safety principles governed by the laws of physics rather than complex engineering. The reactor is fueled by a mixture of thorium and transuranics ({TRUs}) from high-level nuclear waste, dissolved in a sodium fluoride-based carrier salt. Over the 60-year reactor lifetime, the {MSTW} is able to reduce 5 metric tonnes of {TRUs} to shorter-lived fission products and energy. With an outlet temperature of up to 900°C, the reactor supports a wide variety of process heat applications, in addition to electricity production. Together with the simplified safety methodology and a fully modularized design approach, this ensures attractive economics. The design is currently in the conceptual stage, with efforts focusing on advanced neutronics, multiphysics, and early engineering studies.},

Fast breeder reactors have low breeding ratios and long fuel doubling times, so alternative technologies are desirable. A fusion reactor could provide copious neutrons to breed Pu-239 and U-233 in its blanket, supporting several (up to 15) fission reactors for increased energy production. In a liquid fuel molten salt reactor, the chemical processing equipment can remove fission products, separate bred fissile fuel, and adjust the reactivity continuously. The U-233 fuel cycle generates fewer fission products in the blanket and consumes less energy per bred fissile nucleus than the Pu-239 fuel cycle. High fuel burnup fractions (\&gt;90\%) could be attained, and actinides could be recycled in the core and incinerated, instead of being considered waste requiring long term disposal. Russia is developing the Molten Salt Hybrid Tokamak ({MSHT}) to eliminate five vital risks: severe accidents, theft of fissile materials, actinide waste disposal, financial investment loss, and exhaustion of fuel resources.},

Both a molten salt version based on undiluted actinide trichlorides and a liquid metal version using an actinide metal alloy melt with an appropriately low solidus temperature are possible. Fuel processing is done on-site employing a pyrochemical processing unit based on fractional distillation. Medical radioisotopes like Mo-99/Tc-99m are byproducts and can be provided immediately. Other possible applications are synthesis of carbon-free fuels at prices competitive with refined oil and radiotomic chemistry.

	abstract = {The choice of the carrier salt for the molten salt reactor ({MSR}) is discussed in this chapter. Special attention is paid to the solubility of {PuF}3 in these salts necessary for the fast molten salt reactor with U–Pu fuel cycle (U–Pu {FMSR}) operation. It is found that the {PuF}3, {UF}4, and {AmF}3 highest solubilities take place in the eutectic {LiF}–{NaF}–{KF} ({FLiNaK}), which could be an appropriate candidate of the carrier salt for U–Pu {FMSR}. The viscosity, corrosive activity, and other properties of the molten fluoride salts are outlined.
The extremely high solubility of {PuF}3 and {UF}4 in the molten salt {LiF}–{NaF}–{KF} allows for the unification of three ideas: fast neutron spectrum, liquid fuel, and U–Pu cycle. The neutronics calculations of the fast {MSR} based on {LiF}–{NaF}–{KF} with U–Pu fuel (U–Pu {FMSR}) are presented. The schema of the closed nuclear fuel cycle of U–Pu {FMSR} is considered. It is shown that such a system has positive advantages for the fuel cycle of the reactors with the solid fuel elements.
The feasibility of U–Pu fast-spectrum molten salt reactors was certified under certain conditions using alkali fluoride matrixes containing {UF}4 and {PuF}3. These efforts culminated in the novel complex of the molten salt fast breeder reactor ({MSFBR}) using the fuel salt in {NaF}–{KF}–{UF}4 fertile salt and in {NaF}–{KF}–{TRUF}3 fissile salt with capability to satisfy prerequisites as a Generation {IV} qualified reactor.},

Due to this, and the introduction of some further limiting cases, the chapter offers substantial insight into and understanding of the physics and the neutronic behavior of molten salt systems with circulating fuel. After a discussion of the properties of the model and the limiting cases for the static equations, a treatment of space–time transients is introduced, and some limiting cases are solved explicitly. Thereafter the kinetic and dynamic response of the reactor is derived by calculating the space–frequency-dependent neutron fluctuations (neutron noise) induced by small stationary perturbations of the system parameters. The validity of the point kinetic approximation and the calculation of the point kinetic component of the noise are discussed. Finally, the neutron noise induced by various perturbations propagating with the circulating fuel is calculated and discussed.},

The presented case studies also offer a useful analytical framework to assess more sophisticated numerical simulation tools, in view of their adoption for more realistic and complex 3-D analyses.

	abstract = {A transformation of the electricity generation system is required to drastically reduce the associated {CO}2 emissions. In future systems, variable renewable energy sources (wind and solar) are expected to provide a significant fraction of the electricity supply, increasing the requirement for variation management compared with today’s situation. This paper investigates the impacts of measures designed to increase the competitiveness of coal-fired power plants in future energy systems, which are facing restrictions related to {CO}2 emissions and variable operation as a consequence of high penetration levels of wind and solar power. We investigate the cost-optimal compositions of three regional electricity generation systems with different conditions for generation using renewables with a linear cost-minimizing investment model. The model is applied in two energy policy scenarios: one with a tight cap on {CO}2 emissions, and one with a stringent requirement for generation from renewables. In a system with a stringent requirement for electricity generation from renewables but without a {CO}2 cap, coal-based technologies with improved cycling properties provide variation management, given that the development of measures for ensuring improved flexibility continues and reaches full-scale implementation at moderate cost. The effects of improved cycling properties on the system composition are especially relevant for regions with moderate potential for wind and solar generation, in that they reduce wind curtailment and improve the underlying conditions for investments in solar power. In the system with a tight {CO}2 cap, only coal-based technologies with Carbon Capture and Storage ({CCS}) and co-firing of biomass are feasible. Increasing the share of biomass in co-firing technologies to achieve negative {CO}2 emissions increases the competitiveness of these technologies to a greater extent than if simply the cycling properties are improved. A larger co-firing fraction reduces the total system costs, since it facilitates the provision of low-cost flexibility by Natural Gas Combined Cycle ({NGCC}) plants, and it is especially important in regions where nuclear power is otherwise cost-competitive, as low-cost flexibility stimulates investments in wind and solar power at the expense of nuclear power.},

	abstract = {Graphite behavior under Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}) conditions is reviewed and its influence on {MSBR} performance estimated. Based on the irradiation behavior of small-sized graphite specimens, a permissible reactor exposure for {MSBR} graphite is about 3 × 1022 neutrons/cm2 (E {\textgreater} 50 {keV}). The stresses generated in the graphite due to differential growth and thermal gradients are relieved by radiation-induced creep, such that the maximum stress during reactor exposure is less than 1000 psi for reactor designs having a peak core power density of about 100 {kW}/liter and reactor exposures less than about 212 years. The corresponding power costs for single-fluid {MSBR}'s would be about 3.1 mills/{kWhr}(e) based on a capital charge rate of 12\% per year and an 80\% load factor. Experimental data on graphite behavior also indicate that graphites with improved dimensional stability under irradiation can be developed, which would lead to improved reactor performance. The deposition of fission products on graphite does not appear to be large (10 to 35\% of the “noble-metal” fission products based on {MSRE} experience); taking into account graphite replacement every two years, fission product deposition reduces the {MSBR} breeding ratio by about 0.002. Also, it appears that xenon poisoning can be kept at a 0.5\% fraction poisoning level by using pyrolytic carbon as a pore impregnant which seals the surface of {MSBR} graphite and/or by efficient gas stripping of the fuel salt fluid by injection and removal of helium gas bubbles. It is concluded that good {MSBR} performance can be obtained by using graphite having combined properties presently demonstrated by small-size samples, and that development of {MSBR} graphite having such properties is feasible.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) with Th-233U fuel cycle attracts more and more attention with its excellent performance such as desirable breeding capacity, low waste production and high inherent safety. Considering the fact that there is no available 233U in the nature, it is necessary to analyze the fuel transition from enriched 235U/Th to 233U/Th and then give a flexible transition scenario for a graphite-moderated {MSR}. By employing an in-house developed tool which is based on {SCALE}6.1, two scenarios, a Breeding and Burning (B\&B) scenario and a Pre-breeding scenario, are studied. The evolution of the inventories of main nuclides, net 233U production and isothermal temperature coefficient are presented and discussed in the B\&B scenario. It is found that the fuel transition can be achieved smoothly by using enriched uranium with greater than 40\% concentration of 235U. The fuel transition can still be accomplished with 20\% enriched uranium but takes a long double time of about 79 years. Meanwhile, we perform an analysis of the Pre-breeding scenario and conclude that it is efficient to produce 233U and the double time ranges from 2.07 years for the 10-day reprocessing to 10.7 years for the 180-day reprocessing. A comparison of these two scenarios is conducted, which indicates that the B\&B scenario is more favorable than the Pre-breeding scenario from the aspect of resource utilization efficiency. Finally, a combined three-stage program for developing Th-based {MSRs} is proposed.},

	shorttitle = {Nuclear fuel management optimization},
	abstract = {The focus of this overview for this issue of Nuclear Technology, which contains papers presented at the American Nuclear Society Advances in Nuclear Fuel Management {III} ({ANFM}-{III}) 2004 topical meeting, is to introduce the subject of nuclear fuel management for light water reactors. A total of 23 papers was presented on this topic at {ANFM}-{III}. Nuclear fuel management involves making the so-called out-of-core and in-core decisions. Simply put, the out-of-core decisions address the attributes of the new (fresh) fuel that will be fabricated and the partially burnt (shuffled) fuel to reinsert into the core for additional energy production. The in-core decisions address where the fresh and burnt fuel along with burnable poisons should be located in the core. The above applies to batch refueling strategies, e.g., pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors ({BWRs}). For {BWRs}, additional in-core decisions enter to address control rod pattern paired with core flow rate as a function of burnup. It is obvious that the out-of-core and in-core decisions are coupled.

The objective of nuclear fuel management is to minimize the cost of electrical energy generation subject to operational and safety constraints. Since fuel resides in the core for several cycles, a multicycle assessment is required to make nuclear fuel management decisions. For nearly four decades there has been an effort to develop automated computational capability to assist the reload core nuclear design engineer in making nuclear fuel management decisions. This development has ranged from employment of heuristic rules to utilization of mathematical optimization approaches. This overview reviews the development of nuclear fuel management optimization capabilities by first defining the problem, then describing current capabilities, and finally projecting where future capabilities need to be developed to support the needs of reload core nuclear design engineers.},

	abstract = {As part of the continuing development of the boiling water reactor in-core fuel management optimization code {FORMOSA}-B, the fidelity of the core simulator has been improved and a control rod pattern ({CRP}) sampling capability has been added. The robustness of the core simulator is first demonstrated by benchmarking against core load-follow depletion predictions of both {SIMULATE}-3 and {MICROBURN}-B2 codes. The {CRP} sampling capability, based on heuristic rules, is next successfully tested on a fixed fuel loading pattern ({LP}) to yield a feasible {CRP} that removes the thermal margin and critical flow constraint violations. Its performance in facilitating a spectral shift flow operation is also demonstrated, and then its significant influence on the cost of thermal margin is presented. Finally, the heuristic {CRP} sampling capability is coupled with the stochastic {LP} optimization capability in {FORMOSA}-B—based on simulated annealing ({SA})—to solve the combined {CRP}-{LP} optimization problem. Effectiveness of the sampling in improving the efficiency of the {SA} adaptive algorithm is shown by comparing the results to those obtained with the sampling turned off (i.e., only {LP} optimization is carried out for the fixed reference {CRP}). The results presented clearly indicate the successful implementation of the {CRP} sampling algorithm and demonstrate {FORMOSA}-B’s enhanced optimization features, which facilitate the code’s usage for broader optimization studies.},

Nations are investing in {NESs} as a means to establish energy independence, grow national economies, and address climate change. Transitioning to the advanced nuclear fuel cycle can meet growing energy demands and ensure resource sustainability. However, nuclear facilities in all phases of the advanced fuel cycle must be ‘safeguardable,’ where safety, safeguards, and security are integrated into a practical design strategy. To this end, the High Reliability Safeguards ({HRS}) approach is a continually developing safeguardability methodology that applies intrinsic design features and employs a risk-informed approach for systems assessment that is safeguards-motivated. Currently, a commercial pyroprocessing facility is used as the example system. This paper presents a modeling study that investigates the neutron flux associated with processed materials. The intent of these studies is to determine if the neutron flux will affect facility design, and subsequently, safeguardability. The results presented in this paper are for the head-end subsystems in a pyroprocessing facility. The collective results from these studies will then be used to further develop the {HRS} methodology.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a new methodology for explicitly incorporating uncertainties in key parameters into decision making regarding the transition between various nuclear fuel cycles. These key uncertainties—in demand growth rates, technology availability, and technology costs, among others—are unlikely to be resolved for several decades and invalidate the concept of planning for a unique optimal transition strategy. Past time-dependent analyses of the nuclear fuel cycle have confronted uncertainties by using a scenario-based approach where key variables are parametrically varied, which gives rise to inflexible courses of action associated with optima for each scenario. Instead, this work selects hedging strategies through a decision making under uncertainty framework. These strategies are found by applying a choice criterion to select courses of action that mitigate regrets. These regrets are calculated by evaluating the performance of all possible transition strategies for every feasible outcome of the uncertain parameter(s). The methodology is applied to a case study involving transition from the current once-through light water reactor fuel cycle to one relying on continuous recycle in fast reactors, and the effect of choice criterion is explored. Hedging strategies are found that preserve significant flexibility to allow alteration of the fuel cycle strategy once these uncertainties are resolved. This work may provide guidance for agent-based, behavioral modeling in fuel cycle simulators as well as decision making in real-world applications.},

The history, economy, and culture of West Cumbria is intimately connected with the nuclear industry—and, at the time of writing, the region represents the only area of England and Wales for which there are recorded expressions of interest in hosting a {GDF}. The paper demonstrates that controversy centred on the spatial ordering of the siting process by government—a politics that was rooted in the area's history with nuclear waste—and the actors and events that had structured this past. In this regard, I argue for a geographical reading of siting controversy that acknowledges the agency of the absent, and the play of distant others in configuring a public politics of the present.},

	url = {https://www.politesi.polimi.it/handle/10589/74324},
	abstract = {The thesis work investigates the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) technology as a possible route to combine the potential advantages of thorium use in Fast Reactors ({FR}) with the fuel cycle advantages fostered by a liquid fuel. The {MSFR} emerges as a promising reactor for its capability to operate as a flexible conversion ratio reactor. It shows good performances as U-233 breeder, though uncertainties exist on the U-233 capture cross-section in the neutron energy range of interest for the {MSFR}. Operation as a self-sustaining reactor fosters low consumption of natural resources, very limited waste generation, and simplified fuel management thanks to the liquid fuel. The {MSFR} also shows promising features in terms of radioactive waste transmutation thanks to the liquid fuel, the high specific power and the relatively hard spectrum. Safety aspects are investigated through analysis of the reactor safety parameters, and via prediction of the new reactor steady-state after accidental transient initiators. The {MSFR} inherent safety appears comparable to that of traditional {FRs}, especially considering its capability to withstand all major double-fault accidents. In addition, the {MSFR} presents only negative reactivity feedback coefficients, which is a unique feature among fast-spectrum reactors. The system thermal-hydraulics is also investigated in view of the internal heat generation in the working fluid. A correlation is proposed and application to the {MSFR} allows to exclude major impacts of decay heat on the {MSFR} out-of-core components, with a note of caution on the design of channels with low velocities and/or large diameters. In addition, a multi-physics model is developed to investigate the thermal-hydraulic behavior of the core, showing some points of enhancement needed in the current {MSFR} conceptual design. The same model is employed for investigating the reactor transient response to major accidental events, confirming the {MSFR} promising safety features pointed out with simpler approaches, but suggesting also possible problems related to the quick fuel temperature rise in case of a loss of heat sink.},

For shorter periods, the reactor is unstable in the neighborhood of equilibrium unless the prompt xenon yield is a large fraction of the total xenon yield. The reactor power then goes into a stable oscillation. With increase in reactivity, the oscillations are of relaxation type, having the character of a sequence of widely separated power pulses controlled by xenon poisoning. The intensity of the power pulse generally becomes excessive when the reactivity approaches the total controlled by prompt xenon. Xenon burnup is of minor importance over the region controlled by the prompt xenon yield, although it leads to flux divergence at sufficiently short reactor periods.Analytical methods are developed for treating the dynamics of the system, and the prime importance of nonlinear effects is established. The need for data on the independent yield of both Xe135 and its 15 min isomer in fission of major reactor fuels is pointed out.},

This chapter outlines the ways in which the Transatomic Power 1250 {MWth} molten salt reactor design takes advantage of its liquid fuel in order to address these challenges. By employing continuous fission product removal and core geometry modification, the {TAP} {MSR} achieves more than twice the fuel utilization of light-water reactors ({LWRs}). When using 5\% enriched uranium—the maximum enrichment readily available in the current supply chain—this increased efficiency leads to an approximate 53\% waste reduction compared to {LWRs}. Using higher enrichments, up to the 20\% low-enriched uranium ({LEU}) limit, this reduction reaches 83\%.},

The scaling studies presented in this paper demonstrate good weak and strong scaling behavior for the implemented algorithms. Shift has also been validated and verified against various reactor physics benchmarks, including the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light Water Reactors' Virtual Environment for Reactor Analysis criticality test suite and several Westinghouse {AP}1000® problems presented in this paper.

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) was selected as one of the six innovative nuclear reactors by the Generation {IV} International Forum ({GIF}). The circulating-fuel in the can-type molten salt fast reactor makes the neutronics and thermo-hydraulics of the reactor strongly coupled and different from that of traditional solid-fuel reactors. In the present paper, a new coupling model is presented that physically describes the inherent relations between the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor, the heat transfer and the turbulent flow. Based on the model, integrating nuclear data processing, {CAD} modeling, structured and unstructured mesh technology, data analysis and visualization application, a three dimension steady state simulation code system ({MSR}3DS) for the can-type molten salt fast reactor is developed and validated. In order to demonstrate the ability of the code, the three dimension distributions of the velocity, the neutron flux, the delayed neutron precursor and the temperature were obtained for the simplified {MOlten} Salt Advanced Reactor Transmuter ({MOSART}) using this code. The results indicate that the {MSR}3DS code can provide a feasible description of multi-physical coupling phenomena in can-type molten salt fast reactor. Furthermore, the code can well predict the flow effect of fuel salt and the transport effect of the turbulent diffusion.},

Good decontamination is obtained in the fluorination step due to the low volatility of most of the fission product fluorides. An over-all decontamination factor greater than 106 with adequate uranium recovery has been demonstrated in laboratory scale tests using a double bed procedure for the {NaF} step. A pilot plant has been constructed for testing the process with various heterogeneous fuel elements. The engineering and operational features of the pilot plant are described.},

It is realized that applying less normalizations, i.e. employing superhistories, is advantageous. Realistic test problems, both fast and thermal fission, with in- and ex-core local responses, are treated. There is a good agreement between the predicted and actual gain in efficiency.

This work further develops a recently introduced global variance reduction approach, denoted by the {SUBSPACE} approach, and extends its application to reactor analysis problems, where responses are required everywhere in the phase space. In this proof-of-principle study, the {SUBSPACE} approach is shown to reduce the excessively long execution time of Monte-Carlo reactor physics calculations for simplified reactor geometries significantly. By way of demonstration, the {SUBSPACE} approach is applied to assembly level calculations used to generate the few-group homogenized cross sections. These models are typically expensive and need to be executed in the order of 103–105 times to properly characterize the few-group cross sections for downstream core-wide calculations. Applicability to k-eigenvalue core-wide models is also demonstrated in this work. Given the favorable results obtained in this work, we believe that the {SUBSPACE} method significantly enhances the state of the art of Monte-Carlo reactor physics analysis with particular focus on reducing the necessary runtime for achieving accurate results.},

If Monte Carlo estimates of the forward and adjoint fluxes are used, each having global “first-order” errors of O(1/N), where N is the number of histories used in the Monte Carlo simulation, then the statistical error in the {VVR} estimation of k will in principle be O(1/N).

The latest achievement by the center was the successful reprocessing of 100 {GWd}/t burnup mixed carbide fuel with 70\% Pu, discharged from the Fast Breeder Test Reactor ({FBTR}) which is also located in the same center. The designs of the various equipments and process flow sheet had stemmed from the above experiences thereby increasing the confidence level in the future plans of the Department. In this paper, an overview of the experiences in {FRFR} with glimpses of the various developmental activities towards the future plants is spelt out.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) represents one of promising future nuclear reactor concept included in the Generation {IV} reactors family. The reactor can be operated as the thorium breeder or as the actinide transmuter. However, the future deployment of Molten-Salt Reactors will be significantly dependent on the successful mastering of advanced reprocessing technologies dedicated to their fuel cycle. Here the on-line reprocessing technology connected with the fuel circuit of {MSR} is of special importance because the reactor cannot be operated for a long run without the fuel salt clean-up. Generally, main {MSR} reprocessing technologies are pyrochemical, majority of them are fluoride technologies. The proposed flow-sheets of {MSR} on-line reprocessing are based on a combination of molten-salt / liquid metal extraction and electro-separation processes, which can be added to the gas extraction process already verified during the {MSRE} project in {ORNL}. The crucial separation method proposed for partitioning of actinides from fission products is based on successive Anodic dissolution and Cathodic deposition processes in molten fluoride media.

This article builds upon the existing research into {MSRs} to model and simulate the operation of thorium-fueled single-fluid and two-fluid reactors. The analysis is based on neutronics calculations and focuses on denatured {MSR} systems. Resource utilization and basic proliferation-risk attributes are compared to those of standard light-water reactors. Depending on specific design choices, even fully denatured reactors could reduce uranium and enrichment requirements by a factor of 3–4. Overall, denatured single-fluid designs appear as the most promising candidate technology minimizing both design complexity and overall proliferation risks despite being somewhat less attractive from the perspective of resource utilization.},

This type of reactors is distinguished by the use of liquid fuel circulating in and out of the core, which offers many unique advantages but complicates the modeling and simulation of core behavior using conventional reactor physics codes. The {TRITON} control module in {SCALE}6 can perform reliable depletion and decay analysis for many reactor physics applications due to its problem-dependent cross-section processing and rigorous treatment of neutron transport. In order to accommodate a simulation of on-line refueling and reprocessing scenarios, several in-house programs together with a run script were developed to integrate a series of stepwise {TRITON} calculations; the result greatly facilitates the neutronics analyses of long-term {MSR} operation. Using this method, a detailed reexamination of the {MOSART} operation in 30years was performed to investigate the neutronic characteristics of the core design, the change of fuel salt composition from start-up to equilibrium, the effects of various salt reprocessing scenarios, the performance of actinide transmutation, and the radiotoxicity reduction.},

	abstract = {The adoption of Th fuel in fast reactors is being reconsidered due to the potential favorable impact on actinide waste management and resource availability. A closed Th cycle leads to an actinide inventory with lower radiotoxicity and heat load for the first several thousands of years. Due to the typically low {TRansUranic} ({TRU}) Conversion Ratio ({CR}), Th can also be advantageous to expedite the consumption of legacy {TRU}. One of the main obstacles to the implementation of Th is the highly radioactive recycled fuel which requires remote handling under heavy shielding, inevitably penalizing economics and challenging conventional pin-based fuel manufacturing. From this perspective, the development of liquid-fuelled reactors, with Molten Salt Reactors regarded as the most promising, appears particularly attractive as fuel handling would be greatly simplified. The present paper investigates the fuel cycle performances of the reference {GEN}-{IV} Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) in terms of isotope evolution, radiotoxicity generation and safety-related parameters. Similarly to most {MSR} concepts proposed in the past, the {MSFR} is based on the fluoride molten salt technology, but it features the novelty of a fast neutron spectrum. Calculations are performed using state-of-the-art equilibrium-cycle methodologies, i.e., the {ERANOS}-based {EQL}3D procedure developed at the Paul Scherrer Institut and extended to the simulation of the {MSFR}. Selected results have been benchmarked with the Monte Carlo code {PSG}2/{SERPENT}. These results have also been used for the assessment of a diffusion module based on the {COMSOL} multi-physics toolkit, which is the subject of current studies aimed at efficiently simulating the peculiar {MSFR} transient behavior.},

	abstract = {The {CNRS} has been involved in molten salt reactors since 1997. Starting from the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor project of Oak-Ridge, an innovative concept called Molten Salt Fast Reactor or {MSFR} has been proposed, resulting from extensive parametric studies in which various core arrangements, reprocessing performances and salt compositions were investigated to adapt the reactor in the framework of the deployment of a thorium based reactor fleet on a worldwide scale. The primary feature of the {MSFR} concept is the removal of the graphite moderator from the core (graphite-free core), resulting in a breeder reactor with a fast neutron spectrum and operated in the Thorium fuel cycle. {MSFR} has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid fuelled fast neutron systems with unique potential (negative safety coefficients, smaller fissile inventory, easy in-service inspection, simplified fuel cycle…) and has thus been selected for further studies by the Generation {IV} International Forum in 2008.In the {MSFR}, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. This is fundamentally different from a solid fuel reactor where separate facilities produce the solid fuel and process the Spent Nuclear Fuel. Because of this design characteristic, the {MSFR} can thus operate with widely varying fuel composition. Thanks to this fuel composition flexibility, the {MSFR} concept may use as initial fissile load, {\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U or enriched (between 5\% and 30\%) uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by {PWRs} in the world.Our reactor’s studies of the {MSFR} concept rely on numerical simulations making use of the {MCNP} neutron transport code coupled with a code for materials evolution which resolves the Bateman’s equations giving the population of each nucleus inside each part of the reactor at each moment. Because of {MSR}’s fundamental characteristics compared to classical solid-fuelled reactors, the classical Bateman equations have to be modified by adding two terms representing the reprocessing efficiencies and the fertile or fissile alimentation. We have finally coupled neutronic and reprocessing simulation codes in a numerical tool develop to calculate the evolution of the whole {MSFR} system. This tool is used to evaluate the extraction capacities of fission products and their location in the whole system (reactor and reprocessing unit), basis of any safety and radioprotection assessment of the reactor., Le {CNRS} s’intéresse aux réacteurs à sels fondus ({RSF}) depuis 1997. Dans le but de proposer un réacteur critique basé sur le cycle thorium pour la production d’énergie, des études plus complètes sont menées à partir de 1999. Une réévaluation complète du {MSBR} qui constituait alors la configuration de référence des {RSF} est tout d’abord effectuée, suivie d’une étude systématique d’optimisation du comportement de ce type de réacteurs en s’éloignant du design initial. Ces travaux ont permis de faire émerger un concept de réacteur innovant, qui a été sélectionné fin 2008 par le Forum International Generation {IV} comme représentant type des réacteurs à sels fondus et qui a désormais comme dénomination officielle : {MSFR} (Molten Salt Fast Reactor). Il s’agit d’un concept de réacteur surrégénérateur à spectre neutronique rapide et en cycle Thorium, qui présente une très bonne stabilité intrinsèque de fonctionnement grâce à des coefficients de sûreté tous négatifs, et un processus de retraitement du combustible in-situ simplifié acceptable d’un point de vue économique. Ce réacteur se place dans le contexte d’une filière d’utilisation du Thorium qui est un élément fertile abondant dans la nature, en association avec des éléments fissiles naturels ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}235{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou non ({\textless}sup{\textgreater}233{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}U) ou encore qui proviennent de la chaine de gestion des éléments radioactifs à vie longue des réacteurs actuels (Np, Pu, Am, …).Les études menées sont basées sur le couplage du code de transport de neutrons {MCNP} avec le code d’évolution des matériaux {REM} développé au {CNRS}. La résolution des équations de Bateman qui est effectuée permet de connaître la population de chaque noyau dans chaque partie du réacteur à chaque instant. Du fait des caractéristiques fondamentales des {RSF} qui sont très différentes de celles des réacteurs à combustible solide, ces équations doivent être modifiées pour prendre en compte la capacité d’alimentation en matière fissile et fertile, ainsi que le retraitement du sel combustible, de manière continue sans arrêt du réacteur. Nous avons finalement associé le code décrivant l’évolution du coeur et une représentation simulée du retraitement pour construire un outil numérique servant au calcul de l’évolution du système complet. Cet outil permet d’évaluer l’efficacité du retraitement vis-à-vis de l’ensemble des produits de fission (en supposant une efficacité donnée pour le procédé physicochimique utilisé), ainsi que de déterminer leur localisation dans le système. Ces informations sont essentielles pour pouvoir aborder une étude de la sûreté ou de la radioprotection du système.},

The research uses mixed methods, incorporating householder and energy expert surveys, scenario design utilizing the Japanese {MARKAL}/{TIMES} framework, and sustainability and social equity evaluation. Surveys identify householder energy system and participation preferences, alongside energy expert input on social equity and policy design. Scenario building is undertaken to compare energy system outcomes between the strategic Japanese policy approach and a user driven approach to energy transition, both cognizant of 2050 environmental goals. Both scenarios are comparatively assessed using a holistic sustainability evaluation process. Conclusions identify the impact of liberalization and subsequent householder participation in the energy system in Japan, when compared to a strategic, policy driven approach. Both approaches have positive ramifications on social equity and policy burden distribution outcomes. However, the household participation scenario delivers a more equitable outcome, distributing energy policy burdens in a fairer manner through the realization of an energy system which is safe, stable and affordable. The findings have practical applications in participatory policy design, and the development of energy policy which can achieve transition goals while being sensitive to householder preferences and social equity concerns.},

	abstract = {This manuscript analyzes an optimal power generation mix in Japan's nation-wide power grid by considering the post-Fukushima energy policy which puts a high priority on expanding renewable energy. The study is performed, employing an optimal power generation mix model which is characterized by detailed geographical resolution derived from 135 nodes and 166 high-voltage power transmission lines with 10-min temporal resolution. Simulated results reveal that renewable energy promotion policy underlies the necessity for capacity expansion of inter- or intra-regional power transmission lines in Japan in order to realize economical power system operation. In addition, the results show that the integration of massive variable renewable ({VR}) such as {PV} and wind decreases the capacity factor of power plant including ramp generator and possibly affects that profitability, which implies the challenge to ensure power system adequacy enough to control {VR} variability.},

The working group sought to assess nuclear, thermal (fossil fuel-fired) and renewable energy power generation costs in Japan as fairly as possible while considering the latest data made available after the previous estimation by the Cost Estimation and Review Committee in 2011 and revising estimation methods. The 2011 Committee estimated the unit cost for nuclear power generation at 8.9 yen/{kWh} or more (with the discount rate at 3\% and the capacity factor at 70\%) covering decommissioning, additional safety measures, reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels, disposal of high-level radioactive wastes, plant location, R\&D and accident risks. The working group revised the estimate upward to 10.1 yen/{kWh} or more reflecting additional damage compensation and safety measure costs after the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station accident. The unit power generation cost estimate was also raised for fossil fuels due to exchange rate and other changes and for most renewable energy sources due to additional policy costs, while the estimate for solar photovoltaics was lowered due to an actual decline in solar panel prices. Given that the results change depending on preconditions, it is important to assess the economic efficiency of each power source not only by comparing numerical estimates alone, but also by understanding the changes in the estimates.},

	abstract = {The primary objective of this study was to develop fuel cycle options that minimize the nuclear waste generation using sodium-cooled fast reactor systems. In addition, this study aims to develop a new method that improves the accuracy in analyzing one of the developed options that the moderated target assembly was loaded in the fast reactor core. This document summarizes the objectives and lines of work focused on the design studies and performance analyses of transuranic ({TRU}) elements transmutation in fast reactor systems, the development of new depletion method, and the assessment of how well the design meets the objectives.
Two “two-stage” fast spectrum fuel cycle options (Options 1 and 2) were proposed. The first option is a two-stage fuel cycle option of continuous recycle of Pu in sodium-cooled fast reactor ({SFR}) and subsequent burning of minor actinides ({MAs}) in an accelerator driven system ({ADS}). The second option is a two-stage {SFR}/{ADS} fuel cycle option with moderated target assemblies employed in {SFR} to reduce the amount of {MAs} to be sent to the second-stage {ADS}. Design studies were performed to develop reference designs for the {SFR} core, an {ADS} blanket, and a moderated target assembly. The fuel cycle performance was evaluated based on the mass flow data for a nuclear fleet of 100 {GWe}-yr electricity production. For comparison, a single-stage {SFR} fuel cycle with homogeneous recycling of {TRU} was evaluated as well (Option 3).
For the fuel cycle Option 2, the less energetic neutrons in the moderated target assembly enhance the transmutation performance. It is found that the use of moderated target assemblies in {SFR} reduces the number of required second-stage {ADS} by a factor of six without deteriorating safety characteristics. However, the reduced mean free path of neutrons in moderated target assembly presents a potential challenge to the conventional homogenized method used in fast reactor neutronics analyses. Thus, a pin depletion method based on {VARIANT} transport solutions was developed and implemented in a computer code named {VAREPD} to exam the fuel inventory change inside the moderated target assembly.
The verification test result suggests that {VAREPD} calculation can accurately retrieve the nuclide density distribution inside the moderated target assembly. The root-mean-square ({RMS}) error in the nuclide densities at the end of cycle is 5.5\% for Np-237, 3.6\% for Pu-238, 4.4\% for Pu-239, 3.0\% for Cm-242 and 4.1\% for Cm-244. The corresponding two-sigma uncertainties of the reference Monte Carlo solution obtained with the {SERPENT} code are 0.6\%, 1.2\%, 1.8\%, 1.0\% and 4.4\%, respectively. It is also found that both the {VAREPD} and the homogenized assembly calculation of {REBUS}-3 yield reasonably accurate assembly-averaged nuclide densities. It is concluded that the burnup calculation with homogenized assembly models provides satisfactory mass flow data for the fuel cycle analysis but the new pin depletion method would be required in the design optimization and the post irradiation examination, in which an accurate assessment of temperature and fluence distributions is important.
In summary, analysis results showed that all three proposed fuel cycle options could achieve high reduction in the nuclear waste generation because of the continuous recycle of the Pu and {MAs}. The {SFR} in the Options 1 and 2 may have a potential benefit from the fuel fabrication and reprocessing points of view. On the other hand, Option 3 with homogeneous recycle of {TRU} in {SFR} may have the economic advantage over Options 1 and 2. Moreover, co-extraction of Pu and {MAs} would reduce the proliferation risk.},

	abstract = {Critical experiments using an insertion zone with {FLiBe} salt performed at the {LR}-0 reactor at Research Centre Řež ({RC} Řež) have been compared to application models for solid-fueled, fluoride-salt-cooled high-temperature reactor ({FHR}) and liquid-fueled molten salt reactor ({MSR}) concepts using sensitivity and uncertainty (S/U) analysis techniques. These experiments support {FHR} and {MSR} advanced reactor concepts by informing on neutron spectral effects and nuclear data uncertainties related to fluoride salts. The {FLiBe} salt in the {LR}-0 experiments is from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and is enriched to greater than 99.99\% 7Li. This work is part of a broader collaboration between the United States and the Czech Republic on {MSR} and {FHR} technology. Results from the S/U analyses for {FHR} and {MSR} models indicated the most significant potential source of eigenvalue bias due to nuclear data within the {FLiBe} salt is radiative capture in 7Li. Other smaller but potentially significant contributions come from 19F, 6Li, and other 7Li reactions. Similarity comparisons of the {RC} Řež {LR}-0 experiments and {FHR} and {MSR} application models indicate that the {LR}-0 {FLiBe} experiments could be useful as candidate benchmarks for low-enriched uranium–fueled application models. However, sensitivity differences observed included both spectral effects, due to the {LR}-0 reactor being moderated by water instead of graphite and fluoride salt, and sensitivity magnitude effects driven by the amount of {FLiBe} inserted and its location. New experiments with refined designs to increase the volume and importance of salt in the system could provide improved data. Results also demonstrate that salt systems using thorium and/or 233U fuel will require additional experiments with relevant driver fuels. Increased contributions from the graphite moderator and 19F and covariance between reactions such as 233U fission and 233U radiative capture indicate higher uncertainty contributions from the salt and significant differences in contributions from the fuel species due to underlying uncertainties in their nuclear data.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of the current nuclear fuel cycles is not completely achieved since they do not optimise the consumption of natural resource (only a very small part of uranium is burnt) and they do not ensure a complete and efficient recycling of the potential energetic material like the actinides. Promoting nuclear energy as a future energy source requires proposing new nuclear systems that could meet the criteria of sustainability in terms of durability, bearability and liveability. In particular, it requires shifting towards more efficient fuel cycles, in which natural resources are saved, nuclear waste are minimised, efficiently confined and safely disposed of, in which safety and proliferation-resistance are more than ever ensured. Such evolution will require (i) as a mandatory step, evolutionary recycling of the major actinides U and Pu up to their optimized use as energetic materials using fast neutron spectra, (ii) as an optional step, the implementation of the recycling of minor actinides which are the main contributors to the long term heat power and radiotoxicity of nuclear waste. Both options will require fast neutrons reactors to ensure an efficient consumption of actinides. In such a context, the back-end of the fuel cycle will be significantly modified: implementation of advanced treatment/recycling processes, minor-actinides recovery and transmutation, production of lighter final waste requiring lower repository space. In view of the 2012 French milestones in the framework of the 2006 Waste Management Act, this paper will depict the current state of development with regards with these perspectives and will enlighten the consequences for the subsequent nuclear waste management.},

	abstract = {The increased urgency of dealing with mitigation of the looming climate change has sparked renewed interest in the nuclear energy option. There exists a substantial stream of research on the amount of embodied energy and greenhouse gas emissions associated with nuclear generated electricity. While conventional fossil fuelled power plants cause emissions almost exclusively from the plant site, the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in the nuclear fuel cycle are caused in processing stages upstream and downstream from the plant. This paper distils the findings from a comprehensive literature review of energy and greenhouse gas emissions in the nuclear fuel cycle and determines some of the causes for the widely varying results. The most popular reactor types, {LWR} and {HWR}, need between 0.1 and 0.3kWhth, and on average about 0.2kWhth for every {kWh} of electricity generated. These energy intensities translate into greenhouse gas intensities for {LWR} and {HWR} of between 10 and 130g {CO}2-e/{kWhel}, with an average of 65g {CO}2-e/{kWhel}. While these greenhouse gases are expectedly lower than those of fossil technologies (typically 600–1200g {CO}2-e/{kWhel}), they are higher than reported figures for wind turbines and hydroelectricity (around 15–25g {CO}2-e/{kWhel}) and in the order of, or slightly lower than, solar photovoltaic or solar thermal power (around 90g {CO}2-e/{kWhel}).},

In this paper, specific attention is paid to renewable energy technologies ({RETs}) for electricity and heat generation and reviews current understanding and estimates of life cycle {GHG} emissions from a range of renewable electricity and heat generation technologies. Comprehensive literature reviews for each {RET} were carried out. The 79 studies reviewed involved the life cycle assessment ({LCA}) of renewable electricity and heat generation based on onshore and offshore winds, hydropower, marine technologies (wave power and tidal energy), geothermal, photovoltaic ({PV}), solar thermal, biomass, waste, and heat pumps. The study demonstrates the variability of existing {LCA} studies (results) in tracking {GHG} emissions for electricity and heat generation from {RETs}. This review has shown that the lowest {GHG} emissions were associated with offshore wind technologies (mean life cycle {GHG} emissions could be 5.3–13gCO2eq/{kWh}). Results compared with {GHG} estimates by fossil fuel heat and electricity indicated that life cycle {GHG} emissions are comparatively higher in conventional sources as compared to renewable sources with the exception of nuclear-based power electricity generation. In this present study, considering renewable energy sources, waste treatment and dedicated biomass technologies ({DBTs}) were found to potentially have high {GHG} emissions based on the feedstock, selected boundary and the inputs required for their production. The study identifies additional impacts associated with renewable electricity and heat technologies, points out the effectiveness of life cycle analysis ({LCA}) as a tool for assessing environmental impacts of renewable energy sources and concludes with opportunities for improvement in the future.},

	abstract = {An effort is being carried to create a reactor physics benchmark based on the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}). In this framework, detailed benchmark specifications were
compiled and a corresponding model was created using the Monte Carlo code Serpent. The
model was used to analyze the first zero-power critical experiment at {MSRE} when 235U was
progressively added to the fuel salt in order to achieve criticality with stationary salt and
isothermal conditions. The calculated multiplication factor in such conditions was 1.01276
(10 pcm). The total uncertainty for experimental keff was estimated to be 478 pcm. The total
uncertainty of keff from cross section data uncertainty using {SCALE}6.2 56-group covariance
matrices was estimated to be 667 pcm. The benchmark model was also applied to determine
the reactivity loss due to fuel circulation. The obtained reactivity drop (-2247 pcm) matches
well with the value calculated by the scientists at the {MSRE} (-212 pcm). Calculations of the
differential and integral control rod worth also show good agreement with the experiment
values. The benchmark specifications are expected to appear in the International Reactor
Physics Experiment Evaluation Project handbook in next two years},

	abstract = {An analysis of a pyroprocessing safeguards methodology employing the Pu-to-244Cm ratio is presented. The analysis includes characterization of representative used nuclear fuel assemblies with respect to computed nuclide composition. The nuclide composition data computationally generated is appropriately reformatted to correspond with the material conditions after each step in the head-end stage of pyroprocessing. Uncertainty in the Pu-to-244Cm ratio is evaluated using the Geary-Hinkley transformation method. This is because the Pu-to-244Cm ratio is a Cauchy distribution since it is the ratio of two normally distributed random variables. The calculated uncertainty of the Pu-to-244Cm ratio is propagated through the mass flow stream in the pyroprocessing steps. Finally, the probability of Type-I error for the plutonium Material Unaccounted For ({MUF}) is evaluated by the hypothesis testing method as a function of the sizes of powder particles and granules, which are dominant parameters to determine the sample size. The results show the probability of Type-I error is occasionally greater than 5\%. However, increasing granule sample sizes could surmount the weakness of material accounting because of the non-uniformity of nuclide composition.},

In regards to hydrogen production, there has been increasing interest to develop, innovate and commercialize more efficient, effective and economic methods, systems and applications. Nuclear based hydrogen production options through electrolysis and thermochemical cycles appear to be potentially attractive and sustainable for the expanding hydrogen sector. In the current study, two potential nuclear power plants, which are planned to be built in Akkuyu and Sinop in Turkey, are evaluated for hydrogen production scenarios and cost aspects. These two plants will employ the pressurized water reactors with the electricity production capacities of 4800 {MW} (consisting of 4 units of 1200 {MW}) for Akkuyu nuclear power plant and 4480 {MW} (consisting of 4 units of 1120 {MW}) for Sinop nuclear power plant. Each of these plants are expected to cost about 20 billion {US} dollars. In the present study, these two plants are considered for hydrogen production and their cost evaluations by employing the special software entitled “Hydrogen Economic Evaluation Program ({HEEP})” developed by International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}) which includes numerous options for hydrogen generation, storage and transportation. The costs of capital, fuel, electricity, decommissioning and consumables are calculated and evaluated in detail for hydrogen generation, storage and transportation in Turkey. The results show that the amount of hydrogen cost varies from 3.18 \$/kg H2 to 6.17 \$/kg H2.},

	abstract = {Desalination has received increasing attention globally owing to water scarcity. The aim of desalination is to develop techniques and technologies to produce potable water. Desalination methods require energy as heat, electricity, or a hybrid form of both. Nuclear energy is considered a clean, powerful, and gas emission–free option for producing power. More important, there is increasing interest in using nuclear energy for cogeneration applications (extending it to cover nonelectrical applications). Thus, integration of a desalination system with nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) appears to be a potential way to generate both water and electricity. Types of desalination systems can be categorized into two main groups: thermal and membrane. Multistage flash ({MSF}) and multieffect distillation ({MED}) are two available methods for thermal desalination. Reverse osmosis ({RO}) is used for membrane-type desalination. In this study, desalination methods such as {MED}, {MSF}, {RO}, and hybrid systems are considered and compared for steam, gas, and combined cycle ({CC}) (steam–gas)–based {NPPs} in terms of cost and performance by employing the Desalination Economic Evaluation Program software package. In the comparisons, the desalination capacity, water salinity, and economic factors such as the interest rate and fuel escalation are considered and evaluated for each case. The results show that {RO} is the more favorable method for a steam and {CC}-based {NPP}. On the other hand, multieffect distillation with a gas cycle–based {NPP} appears to be the most cost-effective solution.},

Uranium deposits from an electrorefiner contain about 30{\textasciitilde}40 wt\% salts. In order to recover pure uranium

evaporation. A batch operation for the salt removal is carried out by a heating and vacuum evaporation. It
is operated at 700 {\textasciitilde} 1000 {oC} and less than 1 Torr, respectively. The behaviors of the salt evaporations
were investigated by focusing on the effects of the vacuum pressure and the holding temperature on the salt
distillation. The salt removal efficiencies were obtained with regards to the operational conditions. The
Hertz-Langmuir relation was applied to the experimental results of the salt evaporations. The effective
evaporation coefficients of the relation were obtained with regards to the operational conditions. The lower

A spectrum decomposition and reconstruction method based on Principal Component Analysis ({PCA}) is proposed to work with mobile sensor networks. Two experiments are designed to test this method's performance on real-world data. The {PCA}-based method's performance is analyzed using receiver operating characteristic, or {ROC} curves. Further study finds that although the {PCA}-based method doesn't work well on current mobile sensor networks, its performance can be improved by increasing the radiation spectral quality.},

The new normalization database published within this article may be used for {LCIA} case studies within the United States, and can be used to assist in the further development of a global normalization database. The underlying data analyzed for the development of this database are included to allow the development of normalization data consistent with other impact assessment methodologies as well.},

This paper describes the current status and future plans for expansion of nuclear power, the advances in nuclear reactor technology, and their impacts on the associated risks and performance of nuclear power. Advanced nuclear reactors have been designed to be simpler and safer, and to have lower costs than currently operating reactors. By addressing many of the public health and safety risks that plagued the industry since the accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, these reactors may help break the current deadlock over nuclear power. In that case, nuclear power could make a significant contribution towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, significant issues persist, fueling reservations among the public and many decision makers. Nuclear safety, disposal of radioactive wastes, and proliferation of nuclear explosives need to be addressed in an effective and credible way if the necessary public support is to be obtained.},

This review highlights the relevant aspects of sustainability that each method addresses. In addition to analyzing these tools, this chapter demonstrates the application of life cycle models and metrics for diverse sectors including transportation, buildings, renewable energy, and consumer products. Strengths and limitations of these methods and metrics for assessing sustainability are also discussed. The chapter concludes that developing absolute measures of sustainability may be the most challenging area for research. Most of the metrics for assessing sustainability performance are relative metrics rather than absolute measures. In other words, one can say that less of an impact is better but it is difficult to say what is sustainable in the absolute sense. How much carbon dioxide emitted from a product system would be considered sustainable? Even if a sustainable global greenhouse gas emissions target could be established there is no clear method for allocating a global emission threshold to a specific product system.},

	abstract = {The concept of sustainable development from 1980 to the present has evolved into definitions of the three pillars of sustainability (social, economic and environmental). The recent economic and financial crisis has helped to newly define economic sustainability. It has brought into focus the economic pillar and cast a question mark over the sustainability of development based on economic progress. This means fully addressing the economic issues on their own merits with no apparent connection to the environmental aspects. Environmental sustainability is correctly defined by focusing on its biogeophysical aspects. This means maintaining or improving the integrity of the Earth's life supporting systems. The concept of sustainable development and its three pillars has evolved from a rather vague and mostly qualitative notion to more precise specifications defined many times over in quantitative terms. Hence the need for a wide array of indicators is very clear. The paper analyses the different approaches and types of indicators developed which are used for the assessment of environmental sustainability. One important aspect here is setting targets and then “measuring” the distance to a target to get the appropriate information on the current state or trend.},

This analysis is completed in the context of a Hydrogen Economy and competitive electricity markets. The simulation of the operation of a combined nuclear–wind–hydrogen system is discussed first, where the selling and buying of electricity, the selling of excess hydrogen and oxygen, and the selling of heat are optimized to maximize profit to the energy producer. The simulation is performed in two phases: in a pre-dispatch phase, the system model is optimized to obtain optimal hydrogen charge levels for the given operational horizons. In the second phase, a real-time dispatch is carried out on an hourly basis to optimize the operation of the system as to maximize profits, following the hydrogen storage levels of the pre-dispatch phase. Based on the operation planning and dispatch results, an economic evaluation is performed to determine the feasibility of the proposed scheme for investment purposes; this evaluation is based on calculations of modified internal rates of return and net present values for a realistic scenario. The results of the present studies demonstrate the feasibility of a hydrogen storage and production system with oxygen and heat utilization for existent nuclear and wind power generation facilities.},

This work is supported by the {US} Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, under the Nuclear Hydrogen Initiative. This paper will provide an overview of large-scale system modeling results and economic analyses that have been completed to date. System analysis results have been obtained using the commercial code {UniSim}, augmented with a custom high-temperature electrolyzer module. Economic analysis results were based on the {DOE} H2A analysis methodology. The process flow diagrams for the system simulations include an advanced nuclear reactor as a source of high-temperature process heat, a power cycle and a coupled steam electrolysis loop. Several reactor types and power cycles have been considered, over a range of reactor outlet temperatures. Pure steam electrolysis for hydrogen production as well as coelectrolysis for syngas production from steam/carbon dioxide mixtures have both been considered. In addition, the feasibility of coupling the high-temperature electrolysis process to biomass and coal-based synthetic fuels production has been considered. These simulations demonstrate that the addition of supplementary nuclear hydrogen to synthetic fuels production from any carbon source minimizes emissions of carbon dioxide during the production process.},

Special attention is given to innovations that enhance {AMETROP}’s performance both through artificial intelligence features, in which the routine uses the accumulation of data (experience) to influence its future actions, and through a family of simple performance aids, which allow the designer to use his heuristic knowledge (experience) to guide the routine’s essentially random search.

We compared the land transformation and occupation matrices within a life-cycle framework across those fuel cycles. Although the estimates vary with regional and technological conditions, the photovoltaic ({PV}) cycle requires the least amount of land among renewable-energy options, while the biomass cycle requires the largest amount. Moreover, we determined that, in most cases, ground-mount {PV} systems in areas of high insolation transform less land than the coal-fuel cycle coupled with surface mining. In terms of land occupation, the biomass-fuel cycle requires the greatest amount, followed by the nuclear-fuel cycle. Although not detailed in this review, conventional electricity-generation technologies also pose secondary effects on land use, including contamination and disruptions of the ecosystems of adjacent lands, and land disruptions by fuel-cycle-related accidents.},

This same goal could also be achieved by setting all the facility’s ca- pacities to infinity. However, this does not reflect real-world conditions [1]. To address this gap in capability of fuel cycle simulators, the Demand-Driven Cycamore Archetype project ({NEUP}-{FY}16-10512) is developing prediction algorithms to give Cyclus demand-driven deployment capabilities. This means that Cyclus will have the capability to deploy sup- porting fuel cycle facilities to meet front-end and back-end demands of the fuel cycle. The project is a collaboration between the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and the University of South Carolina. This paper will discuss the numerical experiments required to test the various prediction algorithms designed for the project. In particular, this work describes tests for the non-optimizing algorithm.},

It has the dual goals of improving the quality of the software submitted and providing a mechanism for research software developers to receive credit. While designed to work within the current merit system of science, {JOSS} addresses the dearth of rewards for key contributions to science made in the form of software. {JOSS} publishes articles that encapsulate scholarship contained in the software itself, and its rigorous peer review targets the software components: functionality, documentation, tests, continuous integration, and the license. A {JOSS} article contains an abstract describing the purpose and functionality of the software, references, and a link to the software archive. The article is the entry point of a {JOSS} submission, which encompasses the full set of software artifacts. Submission and review proceed in the open, on {GitHub}. Editors, reviewers, and authors work collaboratively and openly. Unlike other journals, {JOSS} does not reject articles requiring major revision; while not yet accepted, articles remain visible and under review until the authors make adequate changes (or withdraw, if unable to meet requirements). Once an article is accepted, {JOSS} gives it a digital object identifier ({DOI}), deposits its metadata in Crossref, and the article can begin collecting citations on indexers like Google Scholar and other services.

It has several peculiarities (e.g. the drift of delayed neutrons precursors), which disable the use of standard dynamics codes. Therefore, the own {DYN}3D-{MSR} code was developed. It is based on the light water reactor code {DYN}3D and it allows transients simulation by 3D neutronics and parallel channel thermal-hydraulics. The neutronics and thermal-hydraulics were modified for the {MSR} peculiarities, where the experience from {DYN}1D-{MSR} development was exploited. The code was validated on experimental results from the {MSRE} experiment done in Oak Ridge National Laboratory and by the comparison with other codes especially with the 1D version. However, by the 3D code transients can be simulated, where space-dependant efforts are relevant, like local blockage of fuel channels or local temperature perturbations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development, validation, and results of a three-dimensional, time- dependent, coupled-neutronics–thermal-hydraulic calculational scheme for channel-type molten salt re- actors ({MSRs}). The reactor physics part is based on diffusion theory, extended by a term representing the flow of the fuel through the core. The calculation of the temperature field is done by modeling all fuel channels, which are coupled to each other by a three-dimensional heat conduction equation. For the purpose of validation, the results of the {MSR} Experiment ({MSRE}) natural-circulation experiment and the thermal feedback coefficients of the reactor have been calculated and compared.
With the aid of a code system developed to implement this scheme, calculations were carried out for the normal operating state of the {MSRE} and some debris-induced channel-blocking-incident transients. In the case of the {MSRE}, it is shown that the severity of such an incident strongly depends on the degree of channel blocking and that high-temperature gradients in the moderator can connect thermally the adjacent fuel channels. Results are included for an unblocking transient (i.e., the debris suddenly exits the core, and the fuel flow reverts to the normal operating pattern), and it was demonstrated that during the unblocking large power peaks can be induced.},

A number of permanent disposal options have been proposed and reviewed by various countries and scientific organizations during the past few decades, and there appears to be a consensus today that mined geologic disposal is the most practical and effective method. Several variations on mined geologic disposal are being intensively studied by waste-producing countries. These investigations address a wide range of scientific questions, such as the behavior of geological and engineered barriers over time and the use of quantitative modeling and/or qualitative observational evidence to demonstrate the safety of disposal. The present review provides an overview of current approaches, scientific issues, and safety assessments related to mined geologic repositories for high-level radioactive waste.},

	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and molten salt reactor ({MSR}) concepts has enhanced interest in building the tools necessary to analyze these systems. A Python script known as {ChemTriton} has been developed to simulate equilibrium {MSR} fuel cycle performance by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt using {SCALE} for neutron transport and depletion calculations. Improved capabilities in {ChemTriton} include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-zone and multi-fluid systems, enhanced time-dependent feed and separations, and a critical concentration search. Although more generally applicable, the capabilities developed to date are illustrated in this paper in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-based {MSR} fuel cycle (a likely scenario requires the first of these {MSRs} to be started without available 233U); (2) determining the effect of the removal of different fission products on {MSR} operations; and (3) obtaining the equilibrium concentration of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor fuel in a two-stage fuel cycle with a sodium fast reactor. The third problem is chosen to demonstrate versatility in an application to analyze the fuel cycle of a non-{MSR} system. In the first application, the initial fuel salt compositions fueled with different sources of fissile material are made feasible after (1) removing the associated nonfissile actinides after much of the initial fissile isotopes have burned and (2) optimizing the thorium concentration to maintain a critical configuration without significantly reducing breeding capability. In the second application, noble metal, volatile gas, and rare earth element fission products are shown to have a strong negative effect on criticality in a uranium-fueled thermal-spectrum {MSR}; their removal significantly increases core lifetime (by 30\%) and fuel utilization. In the third application, the fuel of a mixed-oxide light-water reactor approaches an equilibrium composition after 20 depletion steps, demonstrating the potential for the longer time scales required to achieve equilibrium for solid-fueled systems over liquid fuel systems. This time to equilibrium can be reduced by starting with an initial fuel composition closer to that of the equilibrium fuel, reducing the need to handle time-dependent fuel compositions.},

An extensive library of nuclear data has been compiled, including half-lives and decay schemes, neutron absorbtion, cross sections, fission yields, disintegration energies, and multigroup photon release data.  {ORIGEN} has been used to compute the compositions and radiactivity of fission products, cladding materials, and fuel materials in {LWRs}, {LMFBRs}, {MSBRs}, and {HTGRs}.  The applications are illustrated with calculated inventories and radiation levels for spent fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 {MWd}/metric ton in a {PWR} spectrum.},

Compared with uranium, the standard reactor fuel, thorium is more abundant and harder to divert to weapons production, and it yields less radioactive waste. But thorium can't simply be swapped in for uranium in standard reactors. Taking up the engineering gauntlet, several nations are pursuing thorium reactors in which the fuel is dissolved in a bath of molten salt. India, meanwhile, plans to have a power reactor using solid thorium fuel running within 10 years.
Unsung reactor fuel is more abundant than uranium and, proponents say, safer.

In total, 1449 publications are identified, with the most prevalent topics being Reprocessing and Waste Management, Molten Salt Reactors, Fuels, and Light Water Reactors. In aggregate, reactor-oriented categories (five in all) comprise 45.5\% of publications. The {US} is the most dominant thorium-publishing nation with 916 publications, followed next by India with 82 and then eight other countries having 25 publications or more. National laboratories have contributed 45\% of thorium publications, with roughly equal shares of the balance split between government agencies, universities, and corporations/companies. Oak Ridge National Laboratory in the {US} accounts for more than a quarter of all publications. Specialized criteria are developed and applied to identify some of the most important, or “keystone”, publications for each category. Across the different categories, and for the study of thorium fuel cycles overall, published research reached an intermediate peak in the 1970s followed by a sharp decline in the 1980s and 1990s; however, interest has been revived moving into the 21st century.},

Thorium is frequently found within rare earth element–bearing minerals that exist in diverse types of mineral deposits, often in conjunction with other minerals mined for their commercial value. It may be possible to recover substantial quantities of thorium as a by-product from active titanium, uranium, tin, iron, and rare earth mines. Incremental physical and chemical processing is required to obtain a purified thorium product from thorium minerals, but documented experience with these processes is extensive, and incorporating thorium recovery should not be overly challenging. The anticipated environmental impacts of by-product thorium recovery are small relative to those of uranium recovery since existing mining infrastructure utilization avoids the opening and operation of new mines and thorium recovery removes radionuclides from the mining tailings.},

Firstly, the thermal-hydraulic model of the coupled code is validated by {RELAP}5 code. Then, the mass flow distribution, temperature field, , and power density distribution for a conceptual design of the 2MWt experimental molten salt reactor are calculated and analyzed by the coupled code under both normal operating situation and the central fuel assembly partly blocked situation.

The {JOSS} review process is modeled on the established approach of the {rOpenSci} collaboration. The entire submission and review process occurs openly on {GitHub}; papers not yet accepted remain visible and under review until the authors make appropriate changes for acceptance---unlike other journals, papers requiring major revision are not rejected.

Nevertheless, with higher {VRE} penetration, nuclear energy should adapt to changes in demand and variable energy production, in particular in regions with high nuclear energy shares such as France. We will present some results of a benchmark of technology dispatching tools: {MAEL} from {CEA}/{ITESE}, {OPTIMIX} from {CEA}/{IRSN}, {EUCAD} from {CNRS}/ University Grenoble Alpes and {EcoNUK} from {CNRS}/University of Nantes. The models aimed at reproducing the hourly production of France during year 2012. The total demand as well as the actual productions of wind and solar energies are known and common assumptions for variable and ramping costs as well as technology efficiencies are taken. The compared outputs are agreggated costs, {CO}2 emissions, average load factors for the different technologies. Then we will present some simulation results for the 2030 horizon. Assumptions of demand and installed capacities are taken whether from energy prospective tools (Prospective Outlook for Long Term Energy Supply, {POLES}), or extrapolated from the French Transport System Operator {RTE}. Variations in the average load factors as well as distribution of daily load reductions are computed. These results allow complementary studies, such as those presented by R.

	abstract = {We first formalize the problem and identify the market factors affecting the nuclear fuel cycle such as the capacity factor, the technical lifetime and the license transient budget, the operational cost and the frequency of safety measures due to excessive cycling. A cost calculation methodology is developed based on physics, economics and regulation with the aim of assisting policy makers and industry. The contribution to the literature is the integration of the nuclear load-following operating mode into the overall nuclear cost calculation, with a deep understanding of the operation of a nuclear flexible reactor and its upstream material flow inventory. First, a physical tool ({CLASS}, Core Library for Advanced Scenario Simulation) describes the dynamics of a complete fuel cycle of a representative {PWR} kind reactor and gives insights into the material flow under the constraint of the capacity factor, i.e. the share of the fuel burned to match the nuclear power market demand. ln general, the lower the nuclear power output, the lower the share of the uranium burned, the longer the cycle and the lower the fuel cost. Secondly, a technical-economic model ({POLES}, Prospective Outlook on Longterm Energy Systems) integrates the cost of the uranium cycle calculated with physics criteria and simulates the French power system in 2030 and 2050 under carbon emissions constraint. Thirdly, Poles' outputs, such as renewables installed capacities and flexibility provided by nuclear power plants, are integrated into a sectoral economic model ({EcoNUK}, Economic dispatching of {NUClear} reactors). It is assessed on an hourly basis the operation of the nuclear power fleet over the complete fuel cycle. Model results allow assessing the number of cycles performed with nuclear power reactors, the market demand for nuclear power and a new value of the capacity factor, which can be different from timely aggregated models. The hourly loop shows that punctually nuclear reactors are cycling excessively triggering down the load factor, while eventually they can substitute flexible gas-fired units instead of operating base-load improving therefore the capacity factor. Iterations among disciplines ailow finding stable results in terms of uranium cycle cost and reactors' capacity factors, to ultimately compute the nuclear power generation cost, e.g. the {LCOE} indicator. Preliminary results show that a limited number of iterations is needed due to robust results from the model Poles in terms of nuclear plants' capacity factors. That is, for a large range of the uranium cycle costs, the nuclear power keeps stable its position in the merit order curve that is deregulated market-specific. Two indicators are instead subject to cost cycle variation, namely the system cost to operate the nuclear power plants and the nuclear generation cost.},

This paper proposes a continuous-energy {MC} second-order perturbation ({MC}2P) method as a new way to estimate efficiently the sensitivity of reactivity coefficients to nuclear cross section data. The proposed {MC}2P method takes into account the second-order effects of the fission operator and the fission source distribution. The effectiveness of the {MC}2P method implemented in a Seoul National University {MC} code, {McCARD}, is demonstrated in a Godiva 235U density coefficient problem via comparison of its results with direct subtraction {MC} calculation. It is shown that the new method can predict the cross section sensitivities of the reactivity coefficient more accurately even with much smaller number of {MC} history simulations than the direct subtraction {MC} method. It is also shown that the proposed method is applicable for quantifying the uncertainties of the {MDC} of a {LWR} pin cell problem and the {FTC} of a {CANDU} 6 lattice cell problem due to the uncertainties of the nuclear cross section input data represented by nuclear cross section covariance data.},

Development of new geothermal power stations essentially stopped since the mid 1990s, mainly due to the strong resistance from local communities. Most of the potential sites are located in government-protected areas and in tourist destinations, thanks to the presence of traditional hot springs or onsen. Local communities in these areas are often dependent on revenue from tourists visiting onsen, and are opposed to geothermal developments because of the negative impact that the industry may have on the scenery and the resulting damage to the tourism industry and the local economy.
However, interest in geothermal energy has been increasing in recent years due to the Japanese energy crisis following the Fukushima disaster and the subsequent closure of most of the country's nuclear power stations. Businesses and the government are currently considering over 60 possible sites for new geothermal power development. Estimates put the total capacity potential of geothermal power at 23 {GW}, the third largest amount in the world after the United States and Indonesia. An estimation suggests that about 1,500 hot water wells and springs could generate as much as 723 {MWe} without additional drillings.},

The need for {SNF} storage, even after the first repository is opened, will continue for a few reasons. First, the Obama Administration terminated work on the only planned permanent geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, which was intended to provide a destination for most of the stored {SNF}. Also, the Yucca Mountain project was not funded by Congress in {FY}2011 and {FY}2012, and not included in the Administration’s budget request for {FY}2013. Second, even if the planned repository had been completed, the quantity of {SNF} and other high-level waste in storage awaiting final disposal now exceeds the legal limit for the first repository under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act ({NWPA}). Third, the expected rate of shipment of {SNF} to the repository would require decades to remove existing {SNF} from interim storage. Accordingly, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ({NRC}) and reactor operators are considering extended {SNF} storage lasting for more than 100 years.},

The purpose of the continuing Yucca Mountain study, or project, is to comply with the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 as amended in 1987 and develop a national disposal site for spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste disposal. In 2005, {DOE} shifted the design of the proposed repository from a concept of unloading spent nuclear fuel from transportation canisters and loading into disposal canisters (which required a great deal of handling radioactive material at the repository site) to a “clean” facility, unveiling the transportation, aging, and disposal ({TAD}) canister system.

	abstract = {This paper summarizes the evolution of the engineered barrier design for the proposed Yucca Mountain disposal system. Initially, the underground facility used a fairly standard panel and drift layout excavated mostly by drilling and blasting. By 1993, the layout of the underground facility was changed to accommodate construction by a tunnel boring machine. Placement of the repository in unsaturated zone permitted an extended period without backﬁlling; placement of the waste package in an open drift permitted use of much larger, and thus hotter packages. Hence in 1994, the underground facility design switched from ﬂoor emplacement of waste in small, single walled stainless steel or nickel alloy containers to in-drift emplacement of waste in large, double-walled containers. By 2000, the outer layer was a high nickel alloy for corrosion resistance and the inner layer was stainless steel for structural strength. Use of large packages facilitated receipt and disposal of high volumes of spent nuclear fuel. In addition, in-drift package placement saved excavation costs. Options considered for in-drift emplacement included different heat loads and use of backﬁll. To avoid dripping on the package during the thermal period and the possibility of localized corrosion, titanium drip shields were added for the disposal drifts by 2000. In addition, a handling canister, sealed at the reactor to eliminate further handling of bare fuel assemblies, was evaluated and eventually adopted in 2006. Finally, staged development of the underground layout was adopted to more readily adjust to changes in waste forms and Congressional funding.},

Two-step reduction mechanism for U4+ ions involving one electron exchange in soluble/soluble U4+/U3+ system and three electrons exchange in the second step were found on the nickel working electrode.

Based on cyclic voltammetry, the diffusion coefﬁcients of uranium ions at 530 °C were found to be D(U4+) = 1.64 Â 10À5 cm2 {sÀ}1 and D(U3+) 1.76 Â 10À5 cm2 {sÀ}1. Usage of the nickel spiral electrode for electroreﬁning of uranium showed fairly good feasibility of its extraction.

Additionally, we have developed an online reprocessing simulation tool, {SaltProc} which includes fission product removal, fissile material separations, and refuelling for time dependent analysis of fuel-salt evolution. Initial simulations of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment and the conceptual Molten Salt Breeder Reactor have been conducted on Blue Waters with deterministic multiphysics and Monte Carlo methods respectively. Steady state, transient, and fuel cycle analysis simulations have been run in 2D as well as 3D and compared against the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment. Fuel cycle dynamics and quasi-equilibrium compositions were obtained from depletion and reprocessing simulations for a 20-year time frame. The {MSBR} full-core safety analysis was performed at the startup and equilibrium fuel salt compositions, for important reactor safety parameters.

For finding the solution are researched, researches should be attempted to present a more efficient way to use energy as well as renewable energy resources effectively. Photovoltaic energy power systems take place as the most dominant source among renewable energy technologies. The most important reason is that it is unlimited and clean energy of the solar power systems. Many studies show that photovoltaic power systems will have an important share in the electricity of the future. In this study, to generate electricity from solar energy using photovoltaic systems have a leading position in some European countries, United States of America, China and Japan's current status and future policies will be analyzed in various comments were made.},

Therefore, chemical process models that simulate the operations within an electrochemical used fuel treatment facility are being developed to support the design and implementation of electrochemical process monitoring and material accountability systems. These codes predict the evolving material distribution of uranium and transuranics ({TRU}), as well as significant fission products and process components, in an electrochemical facility and in the electrorefiner in particular. Calculation of the in-process inventory serves as part of an integrated approach to safeguards by informing the design and selection of measurement techniques, sensor arrangement and measurement frequency, and the development of specialized analysis tools. The ability to predict material inventory may also be necessary when direct measurement is not practical during process operations, or when a fully integrated set of processes is not available.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}) research and development has attracted more attention recently. Various concepts of {MSR} designs have been proposed, and related researches regarding {MSR} materials technologies, neutronics behavior, thermal-hydraulic behavior and the reactor safety have been reported. The {MSR} neutronics criticality behavior has significant effect in the {MSR} research aspect. It is important to conduct the comprehensive and systematic investigation of thermal {MSR} neutronics criticality behavior. In this work, the molten salt reactor type that molten salt dissolves the fuel materials is investigated. Therefore, the evaluations of different thermal {MSR} neutronics criticality behavior are conducted in this work. By far, various molten salt fuel types have been proposed by different research institutes based on different considerations. Consequently, the evaluation on neutronics characteristics of different molten salt fuel types and the parametric study of neutronics behavior are taken into account. Furthermore, some molten salt fuels contain the lithium element with the isotope Li-6, which has a large thermal neutron absorption cross section. The evaluation of different Li-6 concentration effects is also considered in this work. In addition to the fuel and moderators effect, other parameters such as the volume and geometry effects are also studied. Lastly, the operation temperature on the neutronics behavior is also investigated. The corresponding parameters such as multiplication factor, neutron spectrum, and temperature coefficient are evaluated. In this work, instead of the simulation of whole reactor core, the simulation of a thermal {MSR} fuel unit is conducted. This work provides a more complete and comprehensive evaluation approach for various parametric effect on {MSR} neutronics criticality behavior and offers reference for the {MSR} criticality design.},

	doi = {10.1007/s41365-018-0458-1},
	abstract = {With respect to a liquid-fueled molten salt reactor ({MSR}), the temperature coefficient of reactivity mainly includes the moderator temperature coefficient ({MTC}) and the fuel salt temperature coefficient ({FSTC}). The {FSTC} is typically divided into the Doppler coefficient and the density coefficient. In order to compensate for the potentially positive {MTC}, the {FSTC} should be sufficiently negative, and this is mostly optimized in terms of the geometry aspect in pioneering studies. However, the properties of fuel salt also directly influence the {FSTC}. Thus, the effects of different fuel salt compositions including the 235235{\textasciicircum}\{235\}U enrichment, heavy metal proportion in salt phase ({HM} proportion), and the 77{\textasciicircum}\{7\}Li enrichment on {FSTC} are investigated from the viewpoint of the essential six-factor formula. The analysis is based on an under-moderated {MSR}. With respect to the Doppler coefficient, the temperature coefficient of the fast fission factors (αT(ε)αT(ε){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}varepsilon )) is positive and those of the resonance escape probability (αT(p)αT(p){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(p )), thermal reproduction factor (αT(η)αT(η){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}eta )), thermal utilization factor (αT(f)αT(f){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(f )), and total non-leakage probability (αT(Λ)αT(Λ){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}{varLambda} )) are negative. With respect to the density coefficient, αT(p)αT(p){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(p ) and αT(η)αT(η){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}eta ) are positive, while the others are negative. The results indicate that the effects of the 235235{\textasciicircum}\{235\}U enrichment and {HM} on {FSTC} are mainly reflected in αT(ε)αT(ε){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}varepsilon ) and αT(p)αT(p){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(p ), which are the dominant factors when the neutron spectrum is relatively hard. Furthermore, the 77{\textasciicircum}\{7\}Li enrichment influences {FSTC} by αT(f)αT(f){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(f ) and αT(Λ)αT(Λ){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}({\textbackslash}{varLambda} ), which are the key factors in a relative soft spectrum. In order to obtain a more negative {FSTC} for an under-moderated {MSR}, the possible positive density coefficient, especially its αT(p)αT(p){\textbackslash}alpha \_\{{\textbackslash}text \{T\}\}(p ), should be suppressed. Thus, a lower 235235{\textasciicircum}\{235\}U enrichment (albeit higher than a certain value, 5 wt\% in this article) along with a lower {HM} proportion and/or a higher 77{\textasciicircum}\{7\}Li enrichment are recommended. The analyses provide an approach to achieve a more suitable fuel salt composition with a sufficiently negative {FSTC}.},

In this market environment driven by persistently low natural gas prices and stagnant electricity demand, we estimate that about two thirds of the 102GW nuclear capacity are uncompetitive over the next few years under the current trajectory. Among those, 18GW are retiring or are merchant plants at high risk of retiring prematurely. The potential consequences of the hypothetical withdrawal of 20GW of nuclear capacity include: 1) a {\textasciitilde}3.2\% increase in carbon emissions of the power sector if replaced by gas-fired units or 2) a significant increase in cost if replaced by renewables. Without a carbon price, out-of-the-market payments would be needed to effectively maintain merchant nuclear capacity. Filling the revenue gap would come at a fleet-average cost of \$3.5–5.5/ {MWh} for these plants, which is much lower than the cost of subsidizing wind power. The policy support could take the form of direct zero-emission credits, renewable portfolio standard expansion, or clean capacity market mechanisms. As a last resort, the exercise of a new mothballing status could prevent the irreversible retirement of nuclear power assets.},

The survey asked about changing to a new power provider, and about the installation of rooftop photovoltaic systems to identify the reasoning behind these choices. Additionally, future hypothetical energy scenarios were tested. The results show that a significant portion of the public make participatory decisions to gain an economic benefit, while another group appears curious about new technology, seeking information before reaching a decision in order to satisfy their curiosity. Both groups are larger than the third significant group, whose decision making is guided by environmental reasoning. The results also show that a large portion of the public are relatively conservative in their energy choices, leading to a very passive approach, while a small portion of respondents demonstrated a more active stance.

First, a benchmark case study is considered which uses Australian brown coal from the Latrobe Valley combined with carbon capture and sequestration ({CCS}) technology. The second and third comparative case studies use renewable energy and electrolysis near port facilities in Karratha, Western Australia, using solar power exclusively as the renewable energy source, and Gladstone, Queensland, using a combination of onshore wind and solar-based generation. The study finds that comparative pilot project generation costs for the brown coal pathway are between approximately 5.9 and 15.4 yen/{kWh} cheaper than for solar and/or wind-based pathways. However, limitations of scaling up {CCS}, a limited brown coal supply, long-term reducing costs of renewables, and the prospect to develop complementary renewable infrastructure make a strong counterargument for investment in solar and wind pathways as an alternative to brown coal and {CCS}.},

However, the term has not been clearly defined, which makes it hard to measure and difficult to balance against other policy objectives. We review the multitude of definitions of energy security. They can be characterized according to the sources of risk, the scope of the impacts, and the severity filters in the form of the speed, size, sustention, spread, singularity and sureness of impacts. Using a stylized case study for three European countries, we illustrate how the selection of conceptual boundaries along these dimensions determines the outcome. This can be avoided by more clearly separating between security of supply and other policy objectives. This leads us to the definition of energy security as the continuity of energy supplies relative to demand.},

	abstract = {Previous studies assessed the feasibility of designing Sodium-cooled Fast Reactors ({SFR}) in a novel Seed-and-Blanket (S\&B) configuration in which a significant fraction of the core power is generated by a radial metallic thorium-fueled blanket that operates in the Breed-and-Burn (B\&B) mode. The radiation damage on the cladding material in both seed and blanket does not exceed the presently acceptable constraint of 200 Displacements per Atom ({DPA}). This paper investigates a number of blanket fuel options other than metallic thorium fuel, including thorium dioxide fuel, thorium hydride fuel, thorium nitride Fully Ceramic Encapsulated ({FCM}) fuel, and Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR}) Used Nuclear Fuel ({UNF}) after limited reprocessing. Since the neutron spectrum of the oxide fueled blanket is softer than that of the reference metallic thorium fueled blanket, it can discharge its fuel at an average burnup of around 110 {MWd}/kg versus 65 {MWd}/kg of the metallic thorium. The two thorium hydride fueled blankets feature an even softer neutron spectrum than the oxide fueled blanket and, therefore, a higher average discharge burnup — 192 {MWd}/kg and 245 {MWd}/kg when the H-to-Th ratio is, respectively, 0.5 and 2.0. The {FCM} fuel is composed of {SiC} matrix and cladding that is expected to self-anneal the neutrons induced damage. With the assumption that the {FCM} fuel will indeed be proven not limited by radiation damage, its discharge burnup could be up to 482 {MWd}/kg. As a result, the corresponding thorium utilization is the highest of all options examined -- close to 80 times the utilization of natural uranium in present Light Water Reactors ({LWRs}). The amount of Trans-Th isotopes accumulated in the thorium blanket per unit of generated electricity decreases as the blanket fuel is discharged at a higher burnup. Therefore, a higher discharge blanket burnup results in lower long-term radioactivity and radiotoxicity. It is also found that the 232U/233U ratio in the discharged thorium fuel is over 3 times higher in the thorium hydride than in the other blankets thus improving the thorium-hydride blanket's proliferation resistance. Softening of the blanket spectrum leads to softening of the seed spectrum region interfacing with the blanket and this enables to discharge the seed fuel at a higher average burnup. The higher discharge burnup of the seed fuel reduces the required reprocessing and fuel fabrication capacities per unit of generated electricity. The cores having softer neutron spectrum blankets also feature less positive feedback to sodium voiding and much more negative Doppler coefficient. When {PWR} {UNF} is used after limited reprocessing to fuel the blanket, the subcritical blanket driven by the excess neutrons from the seed can discharge this fuel at an average burnup of ∼120 {MWd}/kg. Combined with the burnup in the first stage {PWRs}, this two-stage energy system can achieve an accumulated uranium burnup of ∼170 {MWd}/kg. This increases the fuel utilization of natural uranium by a factor of three relative to once-through {PWRs} while at the same time reducing the amount of high-level waste that needs to be disposed of per unit of generated electricity. Another scenario examined in this paper is a 3-stage closed energy system: {TRU} extracted from Stage-1 {PWRs} used fuel is charged to the seed of Stage-2 S\&B cores while the Trans-Th (mainly 233U) extracted from Stage-2 S\&B blanket discharged fuel is used as the fissile feed for Stage-3 {PWRs}. It is estimated that 1GWe of S\&B {SFRs} in such a 3-Stage energy system can support 3.2 {GWe} of {PWRs} versus ∼1.7 {GWe} of {PWRs} that can be supported by 1 {GWe} of {CR} = 0.5 Advanced Burner Reactor ({ABR}).},

Nuclear energy contributes only about 14\% of the world’s electric energy mix today, and as electric energy contributes itself only about 16\% to the end energy use, its contribution is essentially negligible. Still, nuclear energy is plagued already with a long list of unsolved problems. Among the less known problems one finds the difficulties that nuclear plants cannot provide power according to needs, but have to be operated at full power also during times of low demand and regions with large contributions from nuclear power need some backup hydropower storage systems. The better known problems, without solutions since at least 40 years, are the final safe storage of the accumulated highly radioactive nuclear waste, that uranium itself is a very limited and non renewable energy resource and that enormous amounts of human resources, urgently needed to find a still unknown path towards a low energy future, are blocked by useless research on fusion energy. Thus, nuclear energy is not a solution to our energy worries but part of the problem.},

Among the energy-mix, nuclear power is anticipated to have very low {GHG}-emissions. However, its viability is severely addressed by the public opinion after the Fukushima accident. Therefore, a global {LCA} of the French nuclear fuel cycle was performed as a reference model. Results were compared in terms of impact with other energy sources. It emphasized that the French nuclear energy is one of the less impacting energy, comparable with renewable energy. In a second, part, the French scenario was compared with an equivalent open fuel cycle scenario.

In the hydrogen scenario, other processes which are normally supplied by natural gas are reduced because the gas is instead used to generate power. Adding hydrogen to the energy supply leads to a decrease in projected use of fossil fuels.

	abstract = {The present paper is devoted to the analysis of the coupled thermo-fluid and neutronic dynamics of fast fluid-fuel multiplying nuclear systems. A completely coupled model is needed since in some fast reactors designs, the velocity pattern could be very complicated and strongly affected by the neutron dynamics via the heat source from fission reactions. Furthermore, the neutron dynamics is strongly affected by the thermohydrodynamics via the motion of precursors and by feedback effects. The methods typical of solid fuel reactors of previous generations are not sufficient to handle these more highly coupled concepts. In the preset paper, we consider the coupling between neutronics and thermohydrodynamics with simple but realistic hypotheses assumed to model the evolution of all the variables involved in the calculation. The numerical scheme used represents the current state of the art in the solution of non-linear systems: the Newton–Krylov algorithm. Several calculations are presented to demonstrate the ability of the methods described here to study the behavior of molten salt reactors in both steady state and transient situations.},

	abstract = {The National Ignition Facility ({NIF}), a laser-based Inertial Confinement Fusion ({ICF}) experiment designed to achieve thermonuclear fusion ignition and burn in the laboratory, will soon be completed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Experiments designed to accomplish the {NIF}’s goal will commence in 2010, using laser energies of 1 to 1.3 {MJ}. Fusion yields of the order of 10 to 35 {MJ} are expected soon thereafter. We propose that a laser system capable of generating fusion yields of 35 to 75 {MJ} at 10 to 15 Hz (i.e., ≈ 350- to 1000-{MW} fusion and ≈ 1.3 to 3.6 x 1020 n/s), coupled to a compact subcritical fission blanket, could be used to generate several {GW} of thermal power ({GWth}) while avoiding carbon dioxide emissions, mitigating nuclear proliferation concerns and minimizing the concerns associated with nuclear safety and long-term nuclear waste disposition. This Laser Inertial Fusion Energy ({LIFE}) based system is a logical extension of the {NIF} laser and the yields expected from the early ignition experiments on {NIF}. The {LIFE} concept is a once-through, self-contained closed fuel cycle and would have the following characteristics: (1) eliminate the need for uranium enrichment; (2) utilize over 90\% of the energy content of the nuclear fuel; (3) eliminate the need for spent fuel chemical separation facilities; (4) maintain the fission blanket subcritical at all times (keff {\textless}0.90); and (5) minimize future requirements for deep underground geological waste repositories and minimize actinide content in the end-of-life nuclear waste below the (the lowest). Options to burn natural or depleted U, Th, U/Th mixtures, Spent Nuclear Fuel ({SNF}) without chemical separations of weapons-attractive actinide streams, and excess weapons Pu or highly enriched U ({HEU}) are possible and under consideration. Because the fission blanket is always subcritical and decay heat removal is possible via passive mechanisms, the technology is inherently safe. Many technical challenges must be met, but a {LIFE} solution could provide a sustainable path for worldwide growth of nuclear power for electricity production and hydrogen generation.},

	abstract = {The family of Generation-{IV} reactor concepts comprises of multiple promising designs, one of which is the molten salt reactor. These reactors have traditionally been chosen for the possible use of the thorium-uranium fuel cycle and used 7LiF-{BeF}2 carrier salt. This particular salt choice however presents several challenges due to the cost of highly depleted 7Li isotope for the carrier salt, tritium production, and beryllium toxicity. Additionally, lack of developed and accepted safeguards methodology for thorium fuel cycle presents a barrier. While none of these issues are insurmountable, alternatives are worth investigating. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the more cost effective and regulatory amenable fuel salt choices by using low-enriched uranium fuel in the form of {UF}4. Several eutectic mixtures are examined that avoid the use of 7Li and Be while maintaining a melting point low enough to be compatible with standard structural materials. The optimal conditions for hexagonal lattice arrangements using nuclear graphite moderation are discussed for multiple fuel salt choices. The aim of this study is to present options of using simpler molten salt reactor alternatives focused on thermal single-fluid low-enriched uranium converter concepts.},

These initiatives have been virtually brought to a halt for various reasons, except in India, which has continued with its thorium activities. Recently however, new considerations have revived interest in thorium. An overview of the specificities of the thorium fuel cycle was carried out and the most interesting projects launched in the 1960s are recalled.

	abstract = {The {IMSR} uses molten fluoride salt, a highly stable, inert liquid with robust coolant properties and high intrinsic radionuclide retention properties, for its primary fuel salt. A secondary, coolant salt loop, also using a fluoride salt (but without fuel), transfers heat away from the primary heat exchangers integrated inside the core-unit. The coolant salt loop, in turn, transfers its heat load to a solar salt loop, which is pumped out of the nuclear island to a separate building where it either heats steam generators that generate superheated steam for power generation or is used for process heat applications. The safety philosophy behind the {IMSR} is to produce a nuclear power plant with generation {IV} reactor levels of safety. For ultimate safety, there is no dependence on operator intervention, powered mechanical components, coolant injection or their support systems, such as electricity supply or instrument air in dealing with upset conditions. This is achieved through a combination of design features: the inert, stable properties of the salt; an inherently stable nuclear core; fully passive backup core and containment cooling systems; and an integral reactor architecture.},

Coupled to this neutronic approach, the Computational Fluid Dynamics code {OpenFOAM} is used to model the complex flow pattern in the core. An accurate interpolation model developed to take into account the thermal hydraulics feedback on the neutronics including reactivity and neutron flux variation is presented. Finally different transient studies of the reactor in normal and accidental operating conditions are detailed such as reactivity insertion and load following capacities.

Simulation results show that both complete nuclear phase-out and carbon reduction by 80\% in 2050 from 2010 encourage {VR} expansion in the country's power system and cause a quadruple increase of power generation cost at 2050 compared with that under current nuclear capacity and no carbon regulation policy; long-term cost reduction of {VR} energy system is necessary if {VR} is positioned as a mainstream for future sustainable power supply. Secondly, higher levels of {VR} integration decrease the capacity factor of {LNG} combined cycle ({LNGCC}), which implies the challenge to assure {LNGCC} serving as a remunerated ramp generator for {VR} intermittency.

This paper investigates the potential of {PV} resource, which could be systematically integrated into the Japanese power system, using a high time-resolution optimal power generation mix model. The model allows us to explicitly consider actual {PV} and wind output variability in 10-min time resolution for 365 days. Simulation results show that, as {PV} expands, the growth of {PV} integration into the grid slows down when the installed {PV} capacity is more than the scale of the peak demand, although Japan has immense potential of installable {PV} capacity – equivalent to 40 times of the peak. Secondly, the results imply that a large-scale {PV} integration potentially decreases the usage ratio of {LNG} combined cycle ({LNGCC}) in specific seasons, which is a challenge for utility companies to ensure that {LNGCC} is used as a profitable compensating generator for {PV} variability. Finally, a sensitivity analysis on rechargeable battery cost suggests that the reason for suppressing the {PV} output instead of storing its surplus output by the battery can be attributed to the high battery cost; hence, the improvement of its economic performance is significant to integrate the massive {PV} energy.},

	abstract = {There is currently a renewed interest in molten salt reactors, due to recent conceptual developments on fast neutron spectrum molten salt reactors ({MSFRs}) using fluoride salts. It has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fueled fast neutron systems with a unique potential (large negative temperature and void coefficients, lower fissile inventory, no initial criticality reserve, simplified fuel cycle, wastes reduction etc.) and is thus one of the reference reactors of the Generation {IV} International Forum. In the {MSFR}, the liquid fuel processing is part of the reactor where a small side stream of the molten salt is processed for fission product removal and then returned to the reactor. Because of this characteristic, the {MSFR} can operate with widely varying fuel compositions, so that the {MSFR} concept may use as initial fissile load, 233U or enriched uranium or also the transuranic elements currently produced by light water reactors. This paper addresses the characteristics of these different launching modes of the {MSFR} and the Thorium fuel cycle, in terms of safety, proliferation, breeding, and deployment capacities of these reactor configurations. To illustrate the deployment capacities of the {MSFR} concept, a French nuclear deployment scenario is finally presented, demonstrating that launching the Thorium fuel cycle is easily feasible while closing the current fuel cycle and optimizing the long-term waste management via stockpile incineration in {MSRs}.},

	abstract = {Key components of a novel methodology and implementation of an agent-based, dynamic nuclear fuel cycle simulator, Cyclus , are presented. The nuclear fuel cycle is a complex, physics-dependent supply chain. To date, existing dynamic simulators have not treated constrained fuel supply, time-dependent, isotopic-quality based demand, or fuel fungibility particularly well. Utilizing an agent-based methodology that incorporates sophisticated graph theory and operations research techniques can overcome these deficiencies. This work describes a simulation kernel and agents that interact with it, highlighting the Dynamic Resource Exchange ({DRE}), the supply-demand framework at the heart of the kernel. The key agent-{DRE} interaction mechanisms are described, which enable complex entity interaction through the use of physics and socio-economic models. The translation of an exchange instance to a variant of the Multicommodity Transportation Problem, which can be solved feasibly or optimally, follows. An extensive investigation of solution performance and fidelity is then presented. Finally, recommendations for future users of Cyclus and the {DRE} are provided.},

This paper provides an initial description and technical analysis of its key features. The proposed {AHTR} uses coated-particle graphite-matrix fuel similar to that used in high-temperature gas-cooled reactors ({HTGRs}), such as the General Atomics gas turbine-modular helium reactor. However, unlike the {HTGRs}, the {AHTR} uses a molten-salt coolant and a pool configuration, similar to that of the General Electric Super Power Reactor Inherently Safe Module (S-{PRISM}) liquid-metal reactor. Because the boiling points for molten fluoride salts are near 1400°C, the reactor can operate at very high temperatures and atmospheric pressure. For thermochemical H2 production, the heat is delivered at the required near-constant high temperature and low pressure. For electricity production, a multireheat helium Brayton (gas-turbine) cycle, with efficiencies {\textgreater}50\%, is used. The low-pressure molten-salt coolant, with its high heat capacity and natural circulation heat transfer capability, creates the potential for robust safety (including fully passive decay-heat removal) and improved economics with passive safety systems that allow higher power densities and scaling to large reactor sizes [{\textgreater}1000 {MW}(electric)].},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}) are liquid-fuel reactors, in which the fuel is also the coolant and flows through the core. A particular configuration presented in this paper called the Molten Salt Fast Reactor consists in a Molten Salt Reactor with no moderator inside the core and a salt composition that leads to a fast neutron spectrum. Previous studies showed that this concept (previously called Thorium Molten Salt Reactor – Nonmoderated) has very promising characteristics. The liquid fuel implies a special reprocessing. Each day a small amount of the fuel salt is extracted from the core for on-site reprocessing. To study such a reactor, the materials evolution within the core has to be coupled to the reprocessing unit, since the latter cleans the salt quasi continuously and feeds the reactor. This paper details the issues associated to the numerical coupling of the core and the reprocessing. It presents how the chemistry is introduced inside the classical Bateman equation (evolution of nuclei within a neutron flux) in order to carry a numerical coupled study. To achieve this goal, the chemistry has to be modeled numerically and integrated to the equations of evolution. This paper presents how is it possible to describe the whole concept (reactor+reprocessing unit) by a system of equations that can be numerically solved. Our program is a connection between {MCNP} and a homemade evolution code called {REM}. Thanks to this tool; constraints on the fuel reprocessing were identified. Limits are specified to preserve the good neutronics properties of the {MSFR}. In this paper, we show that the limit rate for the reprocessing is 2.5l of fuel salt a day, which means that the fuel should be reprocessed within 7000days approximately if there is a specific way to control the redox potential of the salt. Finally, a last part of this paper analyzes the impact of chemical parameter uncertainties on the reprocessing performance.},

A reprocessing scheme has been established to treat used fuel by extraction of fission products.

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor ({MSR}), as one of the six systems selected by the Generation {IV} International Forum ({GIF}) for future advantaged reactors research and development (R\&D), has excellent performances such as high inherent safety, desirable breeding capacity, low radioactive waste production, flexible fuel cycle and non-proliferation. Meanwhile, thorium, as an appealing alternative nuclear fuel to uranium, is more abundant than uranium in the earth’s crust. Realization of thorium fuel cycle in {MSRs} will greatly contribute to sustainable energy supply for global development. The objective of this paper is to analyze and evaluate thorium fuel utilization in a program in which {MSRs} are expected to be developed step by step. The program can be described as follows:1 The first stage is a converter reactor fueled with low enriched uranium. With limited processing based on current chemical partitioning technology and fuel-feeding techniques in the generation-I {MSR};2 The second stage is a 233U production reactor. By using the enriched uranium, it can produce 233U which does not exist in nature;3 The third stage is a thorium breeding reactor. It is a breeder reactor with Th/233U fuel cycle, and sustainable thorium utilization for energy production is expected to be eventually realized.By employing an in-house developed tool based on {SCALE}6.1, the performance of {MSR} fueled with low enriched uranium is firstly assessed. It is found that {MSR} is attractive regarding conversion ratio when compared with light water reactors. Then we illustrate the feasibility of 233U production in {MSR}. Enriched uranium with two enrichments are used as driver fuels to start {MSR} and produce 233U. The results show that 233U production can be achieved and the double time is about 79.1 years for 20\% enriched uranium and 28.3 years for 60\% enriched uranium. Finally, the performance of {MSR} based on pure Th/233U fuel cycle is evaluated. It is found that breeding fissile material is possible in {MSR} and the breeding ratio is desirable (1.049). Comparison of the three-stage {MSRs} is also conducted and the results indicate that the resource utilization efficiency is much higher in stage-{III} than that in the first two stages and much less minor actinides is produced in {MSR} operating on Th/233U fuel cycle than that in traditional light water reactor.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}), as one of the Generation {IV} advanced nuclear systems, has attracted a worldwide interest due to its excellent performances in safety, economics, sustainability, and proliferation resistance. The aim of this work is to provide and evaluate possible solutions to fissile 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and further the fuel transition to thorium fuel cycle in a thermal {MSR} by using plutonium partitioned from light water reactors spent fuel. By using an in-house developed tool, a breeding and burning (B\&B) scenario is first introduced and analyzed from the aspects of the evolution of main nuclides, net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production, spectrum shift, and temperature feedback coefficient. It can be concluded that such a Th/Pu to Th/233UTh/233U{\textbackslash}hbox \{Th\}/{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} transition can be accomplished by employing a relatively fast fuel reprocessing with a cycle time less than 60 days. At the equilibrium state, the reactor can achieve a conversion ratio of about 0.996 for the 60-day reprocessing period ({RP}) case and about 1.047 for the 10-day {RP} case. The results also show that it is difficult to accomplish such a fuel transition with limited reprocessing ({RP} is 180 days), and the reactor operates as a converter and burns the plutonium with the help of thorium. Meanwhile, a pre-breeding and burning ({PB}\&B) scenario is also analyzed briefly with respect to the net 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} production and evolution of main nuclides. One can find that it is more efficient to produce 233U233U{\textasciicircum}\{233\} {\textbackslash}hbox \{U\} under this scenario, resulting in a double time varying from about 1.96 years for the 10-day {RP} case to about 6.15 years for the 180-day {RP} case.},

	abstract = {A methodology, based on the multiattribute utility analysis, for the assessment of diverse fuel cycles for proliferation resistance was developed. This methodology is intended to allow for the assessment of the effectiveness of safeguards implementation at facilities within a large-scale fuel cycle and allow for the ability to choose technologies based in part on their effectiveness to deter the proliferation of nuclear materials. Fuel cycle facilities under consideration include nuclear reactors, reprocessing facilities, fuel storage facilities, enrichment plants, fuel fabrication plants, uranium conversion plants, and uranium mining and milling operations. The method uses a series of attributes (for example, Department of Energy attractiveness level, weight fraction of even Pu isotopes, measurement uncertainty, etc.) to determine a proliferation resistance measure for each step in a process flow sheet. Each of the attributes has a weighting that determines its importance in the overall assessment. Each attribute also has an associated utility function derived from both expert knowledge and physical characteristics that relates changes in the value of the attribute to its overall effect on the proliferation resistance measure. A method for aggregating proliferation resistance values for each process in a flow sheet into an overall nuclear security measure for the complete cycle was also developed. This method is focused on preventing host nation diversion; however, a similar technique could be used to analyze the risk due to theft by an insider or outsider. This methodology has been applied successfully for example fuel cycles to demonstrate its viability as an assessment methodology and its capability in discriminating diverse fuel cycle options.},

The uranium price at which reprocessing spent fuel from light water reactors ({LWRs}) and recycling the resulting plutonium and uranium in {LWRs} would become economic is estimated for a range of reprocessing prices and other fuel cycle costs. The contribution of both fuel cycle options to the cost of electricity is also estimated. A similar analysis is performed to compare fast neutron reactors ({FRs}) with {LWRs}. We review available information about various fuel cycle costs, as well as the quantities of uranium likely to be recoverable at a range of future prices. We conclude that the once-through {LWR} fuel cycle is likely to remain significantly cheaper than recycling in either {LWRs} or {FRs} for at least the next 50 yr, even with substantial growth in nuclear power.},

	abstract = {A Channel-type Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({CMSFR}) concept is studied to improve the Th-U breeding performance and to reduce the loss ratio of effective delayed neutron fraction (βeff). In the {CMSFR}, fuel salt is filled in the active zone of the cylindrical core for fission heat generation, while fertile salt is contained in {SiC} tubes distributed regularly in the core for 233U breeding and for transferring fission heat from the fuel salt to the secondary loop. To enhance the neutron capture reaction rate of 232Th, both radial and axial Th fertile blankets are adopted. Only a small part of fuel salt in the reprocessing system is adopted for fission products removing and refueling, which reduces significantly the required initial loading of fuel salt compared with a conventional Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}). Based on an in-house developed analysis code for reprocessing system of {MSR}, the Th-U breeding capability of {CMSFR} with different molten salt reprocessing rates (from 10 l per day to 50 l per day) is simulated for a 50-year operation. The simulated results show that the doubling time of 233U with 233U as starting fuel shortens significantly to about 37 years compared with the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}). Furthermore, the Th-U breeding capability with Pu, {TRU} and Low Enriched Uranium ({LEU}) as starting fuels is also analyzed. The simulated results indicate that the doubling time of 233U with Pu and {TRU} as starting fuels is shortened to 22 years and 17 years, respectively. It indicates that both Pu and {TRU} can be employed for a transition approach to Th-U fuel cycle. The largest molar proportion of Pu with {TRU} as starting fuel during operation is about 7.1 mol\% which is under the Pu solubility limit. Although the Th-233U breeding with {LEU} as starting fuel can also be achieved at the end of life of operation, it needs external 233U supply (about 0.6 tons) during the first 20 years operation. Both Temperature Reactivity feedback Coefficient ({TRC}) and βeff for all the starting scenarios are also investigated. The {TRC} for all the starting scenarios is always negative enough during 50-year operation. The total loss ratio of βeff with 233U, {LEU} and Pu/{TRU} as starting fuels is only 13.76\%, 13.47\% and 13.56\%, respectively, which is much smaller than that of the {MSFR}. Considering the limitation of reactor period T  {\textgreater}  15 s, the largest introduced reactivity for 233U, {LEU} or Pu/{TRU} as starting fuel shall not be greater than 110 pcm, 202 pcm and 103 pcm, respectively.},

An important part of {UNF}-{ST}\&{DARDS} is the Unified Database ({UDB}), which contains information that can support a variety of activities including fuel storage, fuel transportation, and disposal-related system analysis. Currently, the main application of the {UDB} is to support evaluation of the characteristics of discharged spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) from the U.S. commercial reactors. However, because of the extensive amount of data that has been collected and analyzed for {UNFST}\&{DARDS}, there are many more applications that can utilize the {UDB} including system analysis with the Next-Generation System Analysis Model ({NGSAM}) and fuel cycle analysis with fuel cycle simulation codes such as {ORION}. Going forward, {NGSAM} and fuel cycle transition analysis with {ORION} integrate {UDB} data wherever possible in the {UDB}’s development plan. These advances in {NGSAM} and fuel cycle analysis can be used in conjunction with the {UDB} to help answer more complex questions about the optimization, utilization, storage, and eventual disposal of {SNF}.},

	abstract = {The successful implementation of disarmament treaties of the last centuries has led to significant amounts of weapon-grade Plutonium which are currently stored in high security storage facilities. Disposing this Plutonium should be seen as ‘good housekeeping’ avoiding unnecessary costs and the hazards of storing this material indefinitely. In addition, the disarmament is only brought to a successful end when the Plutonium isn’t available for the production of new weapons anymore. We propose a disruptive approach for Plutonium disposition and demonstrate the feasibility in a neutronic study. Burning of weapon-grade Plutonium in a molten salt fast reactor is significantly more efficient than in the studied other reactors, while efficient process design has the potential to reduce the security concerns significantly. The proposed system could turn about 1.25 tons of weapon-grade Plutonium into electric energy worth £ 0.5 to 1 billion/year, depending on the electricity price while avoiding the hassle and eliminating the risk of high security Plutonium storage. In conclusion, burning of the weapon-grade Plutonium resulting from disarmament could be an economically very attractive approach to reduce the nuclear threat.},

They can operate on the thorium-uranium fuel cycle which protects the fissile material by the daughter products of the inseparable U-232. {MSRs} can completely fission all plutonium and {HEU}, and as desired, ‘convert’ them to U-233. This also results in high, and efficient resource utilization, while diminishing the plutonium stock. On line processing, when applied, could free the waste from all fissile material. The fuel in the reactor stays protected by the intense radiation of the fission products. Fuel can also be protected in the reactor as well as outside the reactor by denaturing with natural uranium. A wide variety of {MSRs} are available, from ‘once through’ minimum processing reactors to ones with fuel processing which can breed fuel for converters. {MSRs} are extremely safe and simple reactors with good economic potential.},

	abstract = {Korea imports about 97\% of its energy resources due to a lack of available energy resources. In this status, the role of nuclear power in electricity generation is expected to become more important in future years. In particular, a fast reactor system is one of the most promising reactor types for electricity generation, because it can utilize efficiently uranium resources and reduce radioactive waste. Acknowledging the importance of a fast reactor in a future energy policy, the long-term advanced {SFR} development plan was authorized by {KAEC} in 2008 and updated in 2011 which will be carried out toward the construction of an advanced {SFR} prototype plant by 2028. Based upon the experiences gained during the development of the conceptual designs for {KALIMER}, {KAERI} recently developed advanced sodium-cooled fast reactor ({SFR}) design concepts of {TRU} burner that can better meet the generation {IV} technology goals. The current status of nuclear power and {SFR} design technology development program in Korea will be discussed. The developments of design concepts including core, fuel, fluid system, mechanical structure, and safety evaluation have been performed. In addition, the advanced {SFR} technologies necessary for its commercialization and the basic key technologies have been developed including a large-scale sodium thermal-hydraulic test facility, super-critical Brayton cycle system, under-sodium viewing techniques, metal fuel development, and developments of codes, and validations are described as R\&D activities.},

A nuclear fuel cycle study could give convincing answers to many questions in regard to technical aspects. However, one nuclear fuel cycle option cannot be superior in all aspects. Therefore a nation must identify its top priority and accordingly evaluate all the possible nuclear fuel cycle options. For such a purpose, this paper examined four different fuel cycle options that are likely to be plausible under situation of Republic of Korea: once-through cycle, {DUPIC} recycling, thermal recycling using {MOX} fuel in {PWR} (pressurized water reactor), and {SFR} (sodium cooled fast reactor) employing fuel recycling by a pyroprocess. The options have been quantitatively compared in terms of resource utilization and waste generation based on 1TWh electricity production at a “steady-state” condition as a basic analysis. This investigation covered from the front-end of the fuel cycles to the final disposal and showed that the Pyro-{SFR} recycling appears to be the most competitive from these material quantitative aspects due to the reduction of the required uranium resources and the least amount of waste generation.},

The study of scenarios with prospect of 150 {GWe} to 400 {GWe} in 2050 is carried out using the {COSI}6 simulation software, and aims at analyzing the evolution of nuclear energy currently planned in China. Results rely on natural uranium supplies, fuel fabrication, spent fuel reprocessing, quantities of proliferating materials and the opportunity of a rapid deployment of fast reactors ({FBR}). It seems impossible for China to start two fast reactors before 2020 without any external source of plutonium. Anyway, {FBR} may represent at the most around 30\% of the total nuclear capacity in the country by 2050. Indeed the deployment of {FBR} only can start from 2035 to 2040. Finally, the pace of {FBR} development should be controlled carefully by the proportion of {FBR} and {PWR} with respect to the reprocessing capacity. Natural uranium savings appear rather low by 2050, because the transition toward a fast reactor fleet independent from uranium ore lasts decades. However, this independence may be reached by the end of the century, before uranium resources are dwindling, if the first corners to close the fuel cycle are turned in the next decade.},

In recent years, these issues have led to a rise in public opposition in some countries and, thus, nuclear energy has been facing even more challenges. However, continuous efforts in R\&amp;D (research and development) are resulting in new spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) management technologies that might be the pathway towards helping the environment and the sustainability of nuclear energy. Thus, reprocessing and recycling of {SNF} could be one of the key points to improve the social acceptability of nuclear energy. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to review the state of the nuclear waste management technologies, its evolution through time and the future advanced techniques that are currently under research, in order to obtain a global vision of the nuclear fuel cycle strategies available, their advantages and disadvantages, and their expected evolution in the future.},

However, it remains a challenging task to identify all potentially relevant stakeholders and to reliably describe their deeply held beliefs regarding the risks associated with complex industrial systems. For example, the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles presents such a case. Based on a review of policy-making literatures and a content analysis of congressional records, we identify federal agencies and nonprofit policy institutes (also known as ‘think tanks’) as key stakeholders that are representative of those actively involved in making high-level decisions on the {US} nuclear energy policy. Using a semantic network analysis approach, we visually delineate the thematic areas of each party’s perceptions concerning fuel cycle risks. The results show that although governmental and think tank stakeholders share common concerns in areas such as nuclear waste management, the economics of nuclear facilities, and proliferation, they tend to focus on distinct aspects of each area. Moreover, while governmental stakeholders are primarily concerned with the environmental and local impacts of nuclear fuel cycles, think tank stakeholders focus more on the relative advantages and disadvantages of nuclear energy compared to other alternative energy options. Implications for risk management and risk communication are discussed.},

	title = {Utilization of Used Nuclear Fuel in a Potential Future {US} Fuel Cycle Scenario},
	abstract = {To date, the {US} reactor fleet has generated approximately 68,000 {MTHM} of used nuclear fuel ({UNF}) and even with no new nuclear build in the {US}, this stockpile will continue to grow at approximately
2,000 {MTHM} per year for several more decades. In the absence of reprocessing and recycle, this {UNF} is a liability and needs to be dealt with accordingly. However, with the development of future fuel cycle and reactor technologies in the decades ahead, there is potential for {UNF} to be used effectively and efficiently within a future {US} nuclear reactor fleet.
Based on the detailed expected operating lifetimes, the future {UNF} discharges from the existing reactor fleet have been calculated on a yearly basis. Assuming a given electricity demand growth in the {US} and a corresponding growth demand for nuclear energy via new nuclear build, the future discharges of {UNF} have also been calculated on a yearly basis. Using realistic assumptions about reprocessing technologies and timescales and which future fuels are likely to be reprocessed, the amount of plutonium that could be separated and stored for future reactor technologies has been determined. With fast reactors ({FRs}) unlikely to be commercially available until 2050, any new nuclear build prior to then is assumed to be a light water reactor ({LWR}).
If the decision is made for the {US} to proceed with reprocessing by 2030, the analysis shows that the {UNF} from future fuels discharged from 2025 onwards from the new and existing fleet of {LWRs} is sufficient to fuel a realistic future demand from {FRs}. The {UNF} arising from the existing {LWR} fleet prior to 2025 can be disposed of directly with no adverse effect on the potential to deploy a {FR} fleet from 2050 onwards. Furthermore, only a proportion of the {UNF} is required to be reprocessed from the existing fleet after 2025. All of the analyses and conclusions are based on realistic deployment timescales for reprocessing and reactor deployment. The impact of the delay in recycling the {UNF} from the {FRs} due to time in the core, cooling time, reprocessing, and re-fabrication time is built into the analysis, along with impacts in delays and other key assumptions and sensitivities have been investigated.
The results of this assessment highlight how the {UNF} from future reactors ({LWRs} and {FRs}) and the resulting fissile materials (U and Pu) from reprocessing can be effectively utilized, and show that the timings of future nuclear programs are key considerations (both for reactors and fuel cycle facilities). The analysis also highlights how the timings are relevant to managing the {UNF} and how such an analysis can therefore assist in informing the potential future R\&D strategy and needs of the {US} fuel cycle programs and reactor technology.},

This article is devoted to the description of this approach with two different sets of equations depending on the aimed precision. We tested the {TFM} approach in several instances. In the calculation of the kinetic parameters such as βeff and Λeff on the Flattop and Jezebel experiments, the results obtained are compatible with adjoint weighted calculations performed with the Monte Carlo neutron transport code {SERPENT}. Likewise, our calculated value of the αRossi observable is also compatible with the experimental measurement. Finally a time–space prompt neutron propagation induced by a neutron pulse on Flattop has been calculated using the {TFM} approach and compared to a reference time dependent {SERPENT} calculation. Again, the results obtained demonstrate the good characterization of the time–space system response by the {TFM} approach.},

	abstract = {The molten salt reactor ({MSR}), which is one of the ‘Generation {IV}’ concepts, can be used for transmutation, and production of electricity, hydrogen and fissile fuels. In this study, a single-liquid-fueled {MSR} is designed for conceptual research, in which no solid material is present in the core as moderator, except for the external reflector. The fuel salt flow makes the {MSR} neutronics different from that of conventional reactors using solid fuels, and couples the flow and heat transfer strongly. Therefore, it is necessary to study the core characteristics with due attention to the coupling among flow, heat transfer and neutronics. The standard turbulent model is adopted to establish the flow and heat transfer model, while the diffusion theory is used for the neutronics model, which consists of two-group neutron diffusion equations for fast and thermal neutron fluxes, and balance equations for six groups of delayed neutron precursors. These two models which are coupled through the temperature and heat source are coded in a microcomputer program. The distributions of the velocity, temperature, neutron fluxes, and delayed neutron precursors under the rated condition are obtained. In addition, the effects of the inflow temperature, inflow velocity, and the fuel salt residence time out of the core are discussed in detail. The results provide some valuable information for the research and design of the new generation molten salt reactors.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the Generation {IV} International Forum ({GIF}-{IV}), six innovative concepts of nuclear reactors have been proposed as suitable to guarantee a safe, sustainable and proliferation resistant source of nuclear energy. Among these reactors, a peculiar role is played by the Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}), which is the only one with a liquid and circulating fuel. This feature leads to a complex and highly coupled behaviour, which requires careful investigations, as a consequence of some unusual features like the drift of Delayed Neutron Precursors ({DNP}) along the primary circuit and heat transfer with a heat-generating fluid. The inherently coupled dynamics of the {MSRs} asks for innovative approaches to perform reliable transient analyses. The node-wise implicitly-coupled solution of the Partial Differential Equations ({PDE}) that govern the different phenomena in a reactor would offer in this sense an ideal solution. However, such an approach (hereinafter referred to as Multi-Physics – {MP}) requires a huge amount of computational power. In this work, we propose and assess a Geometric Multiscale approach on {MSR}, addressing the core modelling with a 3-D {MP} approach and the remaining part of the system – e.g., the cooling loop – with simplified 0-D models based on Ordinary Differential Equations ({ODE}). The aim is to conjugate the accuracy of the {MP} modelling approach with acceptable computation loads. Reference is made to the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}), due to the availability of a detailed design and experimental data that are used for assessment and preliminary validation of the developed simulation tool.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) can be used as effective burners of plutonium (Pu) and minor actinides ({MAs}) from light water reactor ({LWR}) spent fuel. In this paper a study was made to examine the thermal hydraulic behaviour of the conceptual design of the molten salt advanced reactor transmuter ({MOSART}) [Ignatiev, V., Feynberg, O., Myasnikov, A., Zakirov, R., 2003a. Neutronic properties and possible fuel cycle of a molten salt transmuter. Proceedings of the 2003 {ANS}/{ENS} International Winter Meeting ({GLOBAL} 2003), Hyatt Regency, New Orleans, {LA}, {USA} 16–20 November 2003]. The molten salt fuel is a ternary {NaF}–{LiF}–{BeF}2 system fuelled with ca. 1 mol\% typical compositions of transuranium-trifluorides ({PuF}3, etc.) from light water reactor spent fuel. The {MOSART} reactor core does not contain graphite structure elements to guide the flow, so the neutron spectrum is rather hard in order to improve the burning performance. Without those structure elements in the core, the molten salt in core flows freely and the flow pattern could be potentially complicated and may affect significantly the fuel temperature distribution in the core. Therefore, some optimizations of the salt flow pattern may be needed. Here, the main attention has been paid to the fluid dynamic simulations of the {MOSART} core with the code {SIMMER}-{III} [Kondo, Sa., Morita, K., Tobita, Y., Shirakawa, K., 1992. {SIMMER}-{III}: an advanced computer program for {LMFBR} severe accident analysis.

Proceedings of the {ICONE}-7, Tokyo, Japan], which was originally developed for the safety assessment of sodium-cooled fast reactors and recently extended by the authors for the thermo-hydraulic and neutronic models so as to describe the molten salt reactors. For the adaptation to molten salt reactor, a complete equation of state ({EOS}) for this liquid fuel had to be developed and implemented into the {SIMMER}-{III} code. Through those simulations it was concluded that the thermal hydraulic behaviour appeared to be very important in molten salt reactors concerning design, operation and safety. A flow distribution plate design was found effective to optimize the flow pattern in the core region. Further investigations are under way to obtain optimal flow fields without exceeding design limits.},

	abstract = {Preliminary results of dynamic analysis of a two-fluid Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}) system is presented. Based on an earlier work on the preliminary dynamic model of the concept, the model presented here is non-linear and has been revised to accurately reflect the design exemplified in {ORNL}-4528. A brief overview of the model followed by results from simulations performed to validate the model are presented. Simulations illustrate stable behavior of the reactor dynamics and temperature feedback effects to reactivity excursions. Stable and smooth changes in the various nodal temperatures is also observed. Control strategies for {MSR} operation are discussed followed by an illustration of the open-loop load-following capability of the {MSBR} system. It is observed that the {MSBR} system exhibits a “self-regulating” behavior, minimizing the need for external controller action for load-following maneuvers.},

Using ternary metal alloy and mixed oxide fuels, reference core designs of a medium {TRU} conversion ratio of ∼0.7 were developed by trade-off between burnup reactivity loss and {TRU} conversion ratio. Based on these reference core concepts, {TRU} burner cores with low and high {TRU} conversion ratios were developed by changing the intra-assembly design parameters and core configurations. Reactor performance characteristics were evaluated in detail, including equilibrium cycle core performances, reactivity feedback coefficients, and shutdown margins. The results showed that by employing different assembly designs, a wide range of {TRU} conversion ratios from ∼0.2 to break-even can be achieved within the same core without introducing significant performance and safety penalties.},

	abstract = {The Westinghouse {AP}1000 Program is aimed at making available a nuclear power plant that is economical in the {US} deregulated electrical power industry in the near-term. The {AP}1000 is a two-loop 1000MWe pressurizer water reactor ({PWR}). It is an uprated version of the {AP}600. Passive safety systems are used to provide significant and measurable improvements in plant simplification, safety, reliability, investment protection and plant costs. The {AP}1000 uses proven technology, which builds on over 35 years of operating {PWR} experience. The {AP}1000 received Final Design Approval from the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission in September 2004; the {AP}1000 has also received Design Certification by the {USNRC} in December 2005. The {AP}1000 and its predecessor {AP}600 are the only nuclear reactor designs using passive safety technology licensed anywhere in the world. The safety performance of {AP}1000 has been verified by extensive testing, safety analysis and probabilistic safety assessment. {AP}1000 safety margins are large and the potential for accident scenarios that could jeopardize public safety is extremely low. Simplicity is a key technical concept behind the {AP}1000. It makes the {AP}1000 easier and less expensive to build, operate, and maintain. Simplification also provides a hedge against regulatory driven operations and maintenance costs by eliminating equipment subject to regulation. The {AP}1000's greatly simplified design complies with {NRC} regulatory and safety requirements and the {EPRI} advanced light water reactor ({ALWR}) utility requirements document. Plans are being developed for implementation of the {AP}1000 plant. Key factors in this planning are the economics of {AP}1000 in the de-regulated {US} electricity market, and the associated business model for licensing, constructing and operating these new plants.},

	abstract = {The focus on the issues surrounding spent nuclear fuel and lifetime extension of old nuclear power plants continues to grow nowadays. A transparent decision-making process to identify the best suitable nuclear fuel cycle ({NFC}) is considered to be the key task in the current situation. Through this study, an attempt is made to develop an equilibrium model for the {NFC} to calculate the material flows based on 1 {TWh} of electricity production, and to perform integrated multicriteria decision-making method analyses via the analytic hierarchy process technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution, preference ranking organization method for enrichment evaluation, and multiattribute utility theory methods. This comparative study is aimed at screening and ranking the three selected {NFC} options against five aspects: sustainability, environmental friendliness, economics, proliferation resistance, and technical feasibility. The selected fuel cycle options include pressurized water reactor ({PWR}) once-through cycle, {PWR} mixed oxide cycle, or pyroprocessing sodium-cooled fast reactor cycle. A sensitivity analysis was performed to prove the robustness of the results and explore the influence of criteria on the obtained ranking. As a result of the comparative analysis, the pyroprocessing sodium-cooled fast reactor cycle is determined to be the most competitive option among the {NFC} scenarios.},

The method for determining the chemical elements to be separated is based on the thermal performance of the repository. The important chemical elements are identified, the order of importance of the separated elements is established, and the relationship between the efficiency of the chemical separation and the resulting increase in utilization is determined. The proposed repository at Yucca Mountain is used as an example of a geologic repository for the purposes of illustrating the magnitude of the benefits that are possible and the implications for repository size and operation. This work is being done in support of the U.S. Department of Energy Advanced Fuel Cycle Initiative, where numerous reactor, processing, and recycling strategies are being examined to determine the impact on issues important to the viability of nuclear electricity generation, including the disposal of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear waste.},

	abstract = {A review of existing analysis codes for nuclear fuel cycle systems was performed to determine if any existing codes meet technical and functional requirements defined for a U.S. national program supporting the global and domestic assessment, development, and deployment of nuclear energy systems. The program would be implemented using an interconnected architecture of different codes ranging from the fuel cycle analysis code, which is the subject of the review, to fundamental physical and mechanistic codes. Four main functions are defined for the code. Function 1 is the ability to characterize and deploy individual fuel cycle facilities and reactors in a simulation while discretely tracking material movements. Function 2 is the capability to perform an uncertainty analysis for each element of the fuel cycle and an aggregate uncertainty analysis. Function 3 is the inclusion of an optimization engine able to optimize simultaneously across multiple objective functions. Function 4 is open and accessible code software and documentation to aid in collaboration between multiple entities and to facilitate software updates.Existing codes, categorized as annualized or discrete fuel tracking codes, were assessed according to the four functions and associated requirements. These codes were developed by various government, education, and industrial entities to fulfill particular needs. In some cases, decisions were made during code development to limit the level of detail included in a code to ease its use or to focus on certain aspects of a fuel cycle to address specific questions. The review revealed that while no two of the codes are identical, they all perform many of the same basic functions. No code was able to perform defined function 2 or several requirements of functions 1 and 3. Based on this review, it was concluded that the functions and requirements will be met only with development of a new code, referred to as {GENIUS}.},

Historically, simulation of an entire reactor was accomplished by linking together multiple existing codes that each simulated a subset of the relevant multiphysics phenomena. Recent advances in the {MOOSE} (Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment) framework have enabled a new approach: multiple domain-specific applications, all built on the same software framework, are efficiently linked to create a cohesive application. This is accomplished with a flexible coupling capability that allows for a variety of different data exchanges to occur simultaneously on high performance parallel computational hardware. Examples based on the {KAIST}-3A benchmark core, as well as a simplified Westinghouse {AP}-1000 configuration, demonstrate the power of this new framework for tackling—in a coupled, multiscale manner—crucial reactor phenomena such as {CRUD}-induced power shift and fuel shuffle.},

	abstract = {A nuclear fuel cycle systems modeling and code-to-code comparison effort was coordinated across multiple national laboratories to verify the tools needed to perform fuel cycle analyses of the transition from a once-through nuclear fuel cycle to a sustainable potential future fuel cycle. For this verification study, a simplified example transition scenario was developed to serve as a test case for the four systems codes involved ({DYMOND}, {VISION}, {ORION}, and {MARKAL}), each used by a different laboratory participant. In addition, all participants produced spreadsheet solutions for the test case to check all the mass flows and reactor/facility profiles on a year-by-year basis throughout the simulation period. The test case specifications describe a transition from the current {US} fleet of light water reactors to a future fleet of sodium-cooled fast reactors that continuously recycle transuranic elements as fuel. After several initial coordinated modeling and calculation attempts, it was revealed that most of the differences in code results were not due to different code algorithms or calculation approaches, but due to different interpretations of the input specifications among the analysts. Therefore, the specifications for the test case itself were iteratively updated to remove ambiguity and to help calibrate interpretations. In addition, a few corrections and modifications were made to the codes as well, which led to excellent agreement between all codes and spreadsheets for this test case. Although no fuel cycle transition analysis codes matched the spreadsheet results exactly, all remaining differences in the results were due to fundamental differences in code structure and/or were thoroughly explained. The specifications and example results are provided so that they can be used to verify additional codes in the future for such fuel cycle transition scenarios.},

	abstract = {In this work, the Monte Carlo burn-up code {SERPENT}-2 has been extended and employed to study the material isotopic evolution of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}).

This promising {GEN}-{IV} nuclear reactor concept features peculiar characteristics such as the on-line fuel reprocessing, which prevents the use of commonly available burn-up codes. Besides, the presence of circulating nuclear fuel and radioactive streams from the core to the reprocessing plant requires a precise knowledge of the fuel isotopic composition during the plant operation.

The developed extension of {SERPENT}-2 directly takes into account the effects of on-line fuel reprocessing on burn-up calculations and features a reactivity control algorithm. It is here assessed against a dedicated version of the deterministic {ERANOS}-based {EQL}3D procedure ({PSI}-Switzerland) and adopted to analyze the {MSFR} fuel salt isotopic evolution.

Particular attention is devoted to study the effects of reprocessing time constants and efficiencies on the conversion ratio and the molar concentration of elements relevant for solubility issues (e.g., trivalent actinides and lanthanides). Quantities of interest for fuel handling and safety issues are investigated, including decay heat and activities of hazardous isotopes (neutron and high energy gamma emitters) in the core and in the reprocessing stream. The radiotoxicity generation is also analyzed for the {MSFR} nominal conditions.

The production of helium and the depletion in tungsten content due to nuclear reactions are calculated for the nickel-based alloy selected as reactor structural material of the {MSFR}. These preliminary evaluations can be helpful in studying the radiation damage of both the primary salt container and the axial reflectors.},

The default strategy (Standard Contract) for the U.S. Department of Energy is to use the oldest fuel first ({OFF}) allocation strategy, which would entail the federal government prioritizing {UNF} shipments based on fuel discharge date with the option to prioritize shutdown sites. This may not be the most cost-efficient model given the extensive amount of {UNF} already at reactor sites. Currently, there is no way to preemptively remove fuel from sites that may be close to shutdown or have a higher storage or potential storage cost. As wet storage pools at reactors continue to fill to capacity at operating reactors, the backlog of {UNF} shipments to the {CISF} places additional pressure on operators to expand at-reactor dry storage capacity, thus adding to total system costs.},

	abstract = {Environmental issues and dependence on fossil fuel sources including coal, oil, and natural gas, are the two most prevalent energy issues that are currently faced by the United States. Incorporation of renewable energy sources, a non-economical option in electricity generation compared to conventional sources that burn fossil fuels, promises a viable solution for both of these issues single-handedly. Several energy policies have concordantly been suggested to reduce the financial burden of adopting renewable energy technologies and make such technologies competitive with conventional sources throughout the {US}. In this work, we present a novel simulation framework to help policymakers assess and evaluate policies from different perspectives of its stakeholders. The proposed framework is composed of four modules: (1) a database which collates the economic, operational, and environmental data; (2) elucidation of policy which devises the policy for the simulation model; (3) a preliminary analysis which makes predictions for consumption, supply, and prices; and (4) a simulation model. After the validity of the proposed framework is demonstrated, a series of planned Florida renewable energy policies are implemented into our framework as a case study. The results obtained from the simulation and conclusions drawn on the assessment of current energy policies are presented with respect to the conflicting objectives of different stakeholders.},

	abstract = {Sustainable development requires measures to decrease energy consumption and to avoid any harmful impact on the environment. In recent years, a lot of research has been focused on designing energy systems by emulating the natural ones. This can be regarded as a novel way to support the transformation to sustainable energy systems. The initial step in forming energy systems of thus type, by emulating the ecosystem approach, is the development of a model for rendering the current situation. To contribute to the solution of this problem, an ecosystem model combining the analysis, optimisation and simulation modules has been developed as part of this study. The commonly used models for energy systems are good predictors of the general energy dynamics and structures. However, they can be inadequate when it comes to describing or predicting the complex phenomena within energy systems, such as the large number of parameters, the many end-users, the potential of the technologies, the assessment of the various environmental impacts and the variety of resources. With the implementation of the ecosystem model there is further expanding of the knowledge of an advanced, self-organising methodology integrated within the model’s operation by emulating the natural system dynamics. The ecosystem model could become a valuable tool for developing sustainable energy systems, and allowing the development of the most suitable and sustainable energy system based on the local availability of energy sources.},

An {MSR} could operate at low pressure, avoiding the dangers of evaporation, steam pressure, and hydrogen explosion. The solid fuel could also be replaced by molten salt fuels, such as {UF}4. In a liquid fuel {MSR} the fuel content could be processed continuously to remove fission products, adjust reactivity, and incinerate actinide wastes. The reactor could include {ThF}4 to breed U-233. Most of the thorium could be converted into fissile U-233, but it is more difficult to breed fissile Pu-239 from U-238, and thorium is four times as abundant as uranium in the earth’s crust. The low pressure of {MSRs} allows lighter weight, less expensive vessels. {MSRs} could operate safely at nearly atmospheric pressure and high temperature, yielding efficient electrical power generation, desalination, actinide incineration, and hydrogen production.},

The numerical results indicate that {TMSR}-{LF} has negative reactivity coefficients in term of inlet fuel temperature and core power level, and the response of keff to mass flow is different for cases of nominal power and zero power, and keff decreases with the rise of time of fuel salt spent in external loop and gradually tends to steady. Different mix mode in plenum have a greater impact on the mass flow distribution and delayed neutron precursors distribution, but less impact on core lumped parameter such as keff and effective delayed neutron fraction.},

The Pu-to-244Cm ratio quantification is one of the methods for Pu accountancy in pyroprocessing. However, an uncertainty in the Pu-to-244Cm ratio due to the non-uniform composition in used fuel assemblies can affect the accountancy of Pu. A random variable, {LOPu}, is developed to analyze the probability of detection for Pu diversion of hypothetical scenarios at a pyroprocessing facility considering the uncertainty in Pu-to-244Cm ratio estimation. The analysis is carried out by the hypothesis testing and the event tree method. The probability of detection for diversion of 8kg Pu is found to be less than 95\% if a large size granule consisting of small size particles gets sampled for measurements. To increase the probability of detection more than 95\%, first, a new Material Balance Area ({MBA}) structure consisting of more number of Key Measurement Points ({KMPs}) is designed. This multiple {KMP}-measurement for the {MBA} shows the probability of detection for 8kg Pu diversion is greater than 96\%. Increasing the granule sample number from one to ten also shows the probability of detection is greater than 95\% in the most ranges for granule and powder sizes.},

	abstract = {The quantity of radioactive waste will grow significantly with an increasing interest and use of nuclear-generated energy. There will always be inevitable radioactive waste residues that require disposal, even using an advanced nuclear fuel cycle in the future. Deep geological disposal, one of the most promising final disposal methods, should be validated for its long-term performance and safety assessment. Geotechnical issues related to the deep geological disposal are critical for the sustainable development of nuclear energy. They play challenging roles especially under extreme circumstances that result from deep geological conditions of a repository, extremely long containment time, and the characteristics of nuclear waste itself such as high decay heat, which may primarily affect thermo-hydro-mechanical and geochemical-coupled behavior of a repository for geologic time scales. This paper introduces an overview of deep geological disposal concepts based on Finnish, Korean, Spanish, and Swedish disposal programs, discusses the outstanding research issues in disposal from the aspect of geological and geotechnical engineering, such as {ExcavationDamaged} Zone ({EDZ}), cementitious material, long-term gas migration, and self-sealing/healing of fractured rocks with a focus on the state of the art in-situ validation experiments, and additionally presents a numerical modeling of the coupled {THMG} process in the repository near field, which is one of the major factors concerning the fuel canisters.},

	abstract = {The technological base for high-temperature reactors is the graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel that can operate at temperatures approaching 1250EC with allowable accident temperatures approaching 1600EC. Historically, the reactor coolant has been helium. However, another reactor coolant is also compatible with graphite-based fuels: molten fluoride salts. Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, and the University of California at Berkeley are developing a new reactor concept, the Advanced High-Temperature Reactor ({AHTR}), which uses graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel with a clean high-temperature, low-pressure molten-fluoride-salt reactor coolant. The molten salt has a boiling point near 1400EC. Recent studies have developed a preconceptual design for 2400-{MW}(t) {AHTR}. Two outlet coolant temperatures were evaluated: 800 and 1000EC. The low pressure and high-temperature output matches the need for heat to produce hydrogen using thermochemical production techniques or electricity at high efficiency. While the {AHTR} uses the same coated-particle fuels as those used in helium-cooled reactors, the difference in coolant characteristics and reactor design will likely change some of the fuel requirements. The superior heat transfer characteristics of liquid molten salts compared with those of gaseous helium reduces peak fuel operating temperatures. The decay-heat-cooling system reduces peak accident temperatures by several hundred degrees Celsius. The ability of the molten salt to absorb fission products reduces those fuel quality requirements necessary to minimize off-site radiation exposures under accident conditions. Because more fuel blocks must be moved during a refueling outage, the larger power output of the {AHTR} implies longer refueling times if the fuel has the same geometry and power densities as modular gas-cooled reactor fuel. Consequently, there are strong economic incentives to increase the power density, increase fuel burnup, and modify the fuel geometry to reduce refueling times. Neutronic requirements may require other modifications as well.},

Costs drive the equation, but policies affecting electricity pricing also influence nuclear power revenues at a fundamental level. In current reactors and their associated fuel cycles, capital, operation, and maintenance costs increasingly dominate the economics of nuclear power.
Advanced reactor designs and fuel cycle choices can impact these costs both positively
and negatively. While fuel cycle advancements also impact fuel costs, this component has a relatively small impact on the overall cost of nuclear electricity production, particularly in comparison to capital costs. If advanced reactors can offer very high-temperature heat appropriate for industrial processing, natively couple with storage technologies, or can otherwise acheive load following behavior, then they may become more financially feasible than the current fleet.},

Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the {SaltProc} python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in {PyRK}, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed. Finally, incorporation in Moltres of neutron diffusion and precursor equations will be discussed as will their implementation using the {MOOSE} action system.},

The criteria used for the evaluation are {CO}2 emissions, {NOX} emissions, efficiency, capital cost, operation and maintenance costs, service life and produced electricity cost. A total of 19 scenarios were studied. In 15 of these scenarios, the hydrogen turbine ranked first and proved to be the most preferred electricity production technology. However since the hydrogen combustion turbine is still under research, the most preferred power generation technology which is available nowadays proved to be the natural gas combined cycle which ranked first in five scenarios and second in eight. The last in ranking electricity production technology proved to be the natural gas fuelled phosphoric acid fuel cell, which ranked in the last position in 13 scenarios.},

A simulation was carried out to show how much energy could be produced for a sample future group of scenarios encompassing a variety of solar and wind mixes, and the results show that, with a 1:2 mix of solar to wind energy, the system will always operate at least at 10\% capacity from 10:00 to 16:00, as calculated using the meteorological conditions of the year 2001. This study also analyzes the land requirements necessary to implement such a solar–wind energy system, highlighting the vast areas that would be necessary to be covered with wind turbines and solar panels if such a system were to supply the majority of the electricity demand in Japan.},

An assessment of the feasibility of a 100\% renewable energy electricity system in Japan by the year 2030 was shown to be able to achieve a higher level of electricity resilience. The assessment is based on a simulation of the hourly future electricity production based on wind and solar meteorological data, that can cope with the estimated future hourly electricity demand in Japan for the year 2030. Such as system would use pump-up storage and electric batteries to balance the daily fluctuations in supply and demand, though the most important challenge of the system would be providing sufficient electricity to meet the summer demand peak. These findings have import implications at the policy making level, as it shows that the Japanese electricity generation system is technically able to increase the share of renewables up to 100\%, guaranteeing a stable and reliable supply.},

A probabilistic comparison is then made between two solid sorbents and a commercial amine-based liquid solvent system. Our results show that for a 90\% {CO}2 removal efficiency, the solid sorbent provides an expected net plant efficiency of 32\% (higher heating value basis) for a metal-organic framework solid and 29\% efficiency for a solid amine-based sorbent, versus 28\% net efficiency with a liquid aminebased system using the same reference plant assumptions. Cost estimates for solid sorbent systems, however, remain highly uncertain at this time, mainly because of large uncertainties in capital cost estimates.},

The selection of specific {CO}2 capture technology heavily depends on the type of {CO}2 generating plant and fuel used.

	abstract = {Calculation of wind power capacity values for risk assessment of power system adequacy has attracted great attention in the literature. And the most popular approach has been the Effective Load Carrying Capability ({ELCC}) method which allows for the consideration of key factors such as wind capacity factor, forced outage rates (F.O.R) of conventional power stations, system reliability targets, and the correlation between wind availability and system load. However, comparatively little attention has been paid to analysing the effects of other factors such as the number of wind farms and wind installed capacity, the length of historic time series data on demand and wind resources. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of how these factors influence the calculation of capacity value for the Australian National Electricity Market ({NEM}) power system using metered half-hourly wind and load data for 2006 to 2013. The analysis incorporates the periods with extreme risk events. Our results show that capacity values depend greatly on the design of the simulation model used, and highlight the importance of capturing wind and load data points relating to extremely high demand periods.

We explain why in the 1970s–1980s, the energy paths of the two countries were remarkably similar, but since the 1990s Germany has become a leader in renewables while phasing out nuclear energy, whereas Japan has deployed less renewables while becoming a leader in nuclear power. We link these differences to the faster growth of electricity demand and energy insecurity in Japan, the easier diffusion of onshore wind power technology and the weakening of the nuclear power regime induced by stagnation and competition from coal and renewables in Germany. We show how these changes involve the interplay of five distinct mechanisms which may also play a role in other energy transitions.},

We analyzed a large set of scenarios by combining a wind resource model and a computable general equilibrium ({CGE}) model. Five factors, including onshore wind resource potential, investment cost, balancing cost, transmission cost and climate change mitigation policy, were considered to generate 96 scenarios and regression analysis was used to assess relevance among the factors. We found that the strongest factors were resource potential and climate target, followed by wind power technology investment cost. Other factors, such as balancing and transmission costs, had relatively smaller impacts. World total onshore wind power in 2050 increases by 13.2 and 15.5 (41\% and 49\% of 2005 total power generation, respectively) {EJ}/year if wind potential rises from low to medium and high levels, respectively. Furthermore, 5.9, 17.8, and 24.3 {EJ}/year of additional wind power could be generated under climate targets of 650, 550 and 450 ppm {CO}2-eq, respectively. Moreover, reducing wind power technology investment cost would increase global wind power by another 9.2 {EJ}/year. The methodology can be extended to assess other mitigation technologies if the related data is available.},

Compared with nuclear energy and biomass energy, the authors find that wind, water, and solar power, alone, would not only be advantageous but also feasible to meet 100 percent of the world’s energy needs. They explain how renewable energy systems can be designed and operated to ensure that power generation reliably matches demand; they calculate that these energy sources would cost less than fossil fuels when all costs to society are considered; and they recommend policies for easing the transition to energy systems based entirely on wind, water, and solar power.},

	abstract = {In the framework of the {ASTRID} project at {CEA}, core design studies are performed at {CEA} with the {AREVA} and {EDF} support. At the stage of the project, pre-conceptual design studies are conducted in accordance with {GEN} {IV} reactors criteria, in particularly for safety improvements. An improved safety for a sodium cooled reactor requires revisiting many aspects of the design and is a rather lengthy process in current design approach. Two types of cores are under evaluation, one classical derivated from the {SFR} V2B and one more challenging called {CFV} (low void effect core) with a large gain on the sodium void effect. The {SFR} V2b core have the following specifications : a very low burn-up reactivity swing (due to a small cycle reactivity loss) and a reduced sodium void effect with regard to past designs such as the {EFR} (around 2\$ minus). Its performances are an average burn-up of 100 {GWd}/t, and an internal conversion ratio equal to one given a very good behavior of this core during a control rod withdrawal transient). The {CFV} with its specific design offers a negative sodium void worth while maintaining core performances. In accordance of {ASTRID} needs for demonstration those cores are 1500 {MWth} power (600 {MWe}). This paper will focus on the {CFV} pre-conceptual design of the core and S/A, and the performances in terms of safety will be evaluated on different transient scenario like {ULOF}, in order to assess its intrinsic behavior compared to a more classical design like V2B core. The gap in term of margin to a severe accident due to a loss of flow initiator underlines the potential capability of this type of core to enhance prevention of severe accident in accordance to safety demonstration.

	abstract = {This article reviews the history and current issues of wind energy development in Japan and considers the role of policy and future direction of wind energy. Past policy with its weak market focus did not increase wind energy share in Japan. The situation surrounding wind and other renewable energy changed dramatically after the Great East Earthquake and Tsunami and the subsequent Fukushima Nuclear Plant Accident in early 2011. The new Feed-in Tariff regime was introduced and the Electricity Sector Reform is slowly progressing. Although wind energy has much larger potential than other renewables in Japan, the {FIT} has not increased wind installation to date, and the number of bottlenecks has hindered large-scale market deployment of wind. The limited grid capacity, the current electricity market structure, and grid operating practices by the existing Electricity Power Companies have constrained the grid access of wind projects. A layer of regulations related to development permits increases lead-time, project uncertainty, and risk premiums. Difficulty in terms of social acceptance is also high due to some of the past mistakes which did not address local community concerns. Cost of wind energy is also high, compared with other countries, due to lack of economies of scale and other reasons. Japan needs to implement a more comprehensive policy package to address numerous bottlenecks and risks to increase wind energy share in its energy mix.},

	abstract = {This report aims to clarify many of the issues being discussed within the {AFCI} program, including Inert Matrix Fuel ({IMF}) versus Mixed Oxide ({MOX}) fuel, single-pass versus multi-pass recycling, thermal versus fast reactors, potential need for transmutation of technetium and iodine, and the value of separating cesium and strontium. It documents most of the work produced by {INL}, {ANL}, and {SNL} personnel under their Simulation, Evaluation, and Trade Study ({SETS}) work packages during {FY}2005 and the first half of {FY}2006. This report represents the first attempt to calculate a full range of metrics, covering all four {AFCI} program objectives - waste management, proliferation resistance, energy recovery, and systematic management/economics/safety - using a combination of "static" calculations and a system dynamic model, {DYMOND}. In many cases, we examine the same issue both dynamically and statically to determine the robustness of the observations. All analyses are for the U.S. reactor fleet. This is a technical report, not aimed at a policy-level audience. A wide range of options are studied to provide the technical basis for identifying the most attractive options and potential improvements. Option improvement could be vital to accomplish before the {AFCI} program publishes definitive cost estimates. Information from this report will be extracted and summarized in future policy-level reports. Many dynamic simulations of deploying those options are included. There are few "control knobs" for flying or piloting the fuel cycle system into the future, even though it is dark (uncertain) and controls are sluggish with slow time response: what types of reactors are built, what types of fuels are used, and the capacity of separation and fabrication plants. Piloting responsibilities are distributed among utilities, government, and regulators, compounding the challenge of making the entire system work and respond to changing circumstances. We identify four approaches that would increase our ability to pilot the fuel cycle system: (1) have a recycle strategy that could be implemented before the 2030-2050 approximate period when current reactors retire so that replacement reactors fit into the strategy, (2) establish an option such as multi-pass blended-core {IMF} as a downward plutonium control knob and accumulate waste management benefits early, (3) establish fast reactors with flexible conversion ratio as a future control knob that slowly becomes available if/when fast reactors are added to the fleet, and (4) expand exploration of blended assemblies and cores, which appear to have advantages and agility. Initial results suggest multi-pass full-core {MOX} appears to be a less effective way than multi-pass blended core {IMF} to manage the fuel cycle system because it requires higher {TRU} throughput while more slowly accruing waste management benefits. Single-pass recycle approaches for {LWRs} (we did not study the {VHTR}) do not meet {AFCI} program objectives and could be considered a "dead end". Fast reactors appear to be effective options but a significant number of fast reactors must be deployed before the benefit of such strategies can be observed.},

The pre-conceptual design studies are being conducted in accordance with the {GEN} {IV} reactor objectives, particularly in terms of improving safety. This involves limiting the consequences of 1) a hypothetical control rod withdrawal accident (by minimizing the core reactivity loss during the irradiation cycle), and 2) an hypothetical loss-of-flow accident (by reducing the sodium void worth). Two types of cores are being studied for the {ASTRID} project. The first is based on a ‘large pin/small spacing wire’ concept derived from the {SFR} V2b, while the other is based on an innovative {CFV} design. A distinctive feature of the {CFV} core is its negative sodium void worth. In 2011, the evaluation of a preliminary version (v1) of this {CFV} core for {ASTRID} underlined its potential capacity to improve the prevention of severe accidents. An improved version of the {ASTRID} {CFV} core (v2) was proposed in 2012 to comply with all the control rod withdrawal criteria, while increasing safety margins for all unprotected-loss-of-flow ({ULOF}) transients and improving the general design. This paper describes the {CFV} v2 design options and reports on the progress of the studies at the end of pre-conceptual design phase 1 concerning: –Core performance,–Intrinsic behavior during unprotected transients,–Simulation of severe accident scenarios,–Qualification requirements. The paper also specifies the open options for the materials, sub-assemblies, absorbers, and core monitoring that will continue to be studied during the conceptual design phase.},

For robustness, this package employs various tools within the scientific python ecosystem. For additional ease of use, it employs a reactor-agnostic, object-oriented data model, allowing nuclear engineers to rapidly prototype nuclear reactor control and safety systems in the context of their novel nuclear reactor designs.},

	abstract = {As I considered how {ANS} could best forward the interests of nuclear professionals 
during my term as president (June 2016-June 2017), I was compelled by the idea 
of identifying the technical nuclear challenges that need to be resolved by 2030 
in order to help solve some of the economic, sociological, or political issues that 
we face as a society.
It was important to engage {ANS} members in the selection process, because they 
are  the  specialists  best  positioned  to  know  the  current  landscape  and  potential  
for the future of nuclear technologies. We launched the Nuclear Grand Challenges 
effort by first conducting a roundtable brainstorming session with more than 125 
nuclear  professionals  at  the  {ANS}  Winter  Meeting  in  November  2016.  Then  all  
{ANS}  members,  as  well  as  the  public,  were  invited  to  submit  their  ideas.  The  
responses we received far exceeded my expectations, with nearly 300 separate 
recommendations submitted, many of which were similar enough to consolidate.
Those  suggestions  were  categorized  by  specialty  areas  then  vetted  by  the  
appropriate {ANS} Professional Divisions. The divisions were invited to submit up 
to  three  suggestions  for  the  final  Nuclear  Grand  Challenges  from  their  areas  of  
expertise. Those items were then reviewed and voted on by all members of the 
{ANS} board of directors, as well as the division chairs. 
The  results  are  the  {ANS}  Nuclear  Grand  Challenges  described  in  this  report.  
I  hope  these  will  provide  an  opportunity  for  our  members  and  other  interested  
parties  to  drive  conversations  about  the  difficult  things  we  need  to  address  to  
advance  the  benefits  of  nuclear  science  and  technology  for  future  generations.  
This report was created to catalog the identified challenges and provide focus for 
those who will continue our mission to share information by engaging the public 
and policymakers and foster advancements in nuclear technology. I look forward 
to being actively involved in finding solutions.},

The process includes the identification of Critical Technology Elements ({CTEs}), followed by in-depth evaluation of Technology Readiness Levels ({TRLs}) and development of Technology Maturation Plans ({TMPs}) for those {CTEs}. This approach was augmented for the {NTRD} program to include System Readiness Levels ({SRLs}) as a complement to {TRLs}, and developing perspective tracks to better organize the {TRL}/{SRL} evaluations that determine the level of knowledge/maturation of the {CTEs} (e.g. Experiments \& Modeling, Safety \& Hazards, Manufacturing, etc.). The augmented approach was tested on two areas of research in 2017 (metallic nuclear fuels and fuel dissolution for recycling) and is now being applied to a complete advanced nuclear fuel cycle (from uranium mining to waste disposal).},

We design a fundamental electricity market model, where renewable energy capacity is not driven by expansion goals, but is dynamically modeled as an economically-driven investment option. Furthermore, we analyze the economics of five policy scenarios designed to secure both electricity supply and renewable energy expansion. Our analysis demonstrates that renewable energy expansion leads to conventional power plant shut-downs (due to economic losses) and, as a result, to energy shortages. We find that the application of a fixed feed-in tariff mechanism for renewable energy (i.e. a fixed payment for the provided energy) is an appropriate instrument to simultaneously achieve renewable energy expansion and uninterrupted energy supply. However, when internalizing the external costs of electricity generation, the scenario of a free market for renewable energy together with subsidies for conventional power plants becomes the most cost efficient option.},

	abstract = {Experience with modeling fuel cycle options reveals that the large amount of generated data makes it difficult to understand trade-offs among fuel cycle policies. This paper shows that numerical optimization can be used to better identify impacts of fuel cycle policies and condense the generated data against a few significant criteria. The once-through cycle is considered the baseline case, while advanced technologies with fuel recycling characterize the alternative fuel cycle options available in the future. The options include, among others, recycling the fissile materials from spent light water reactor fuel in fast reactors ({FRs}) as well as deployment of innovative recycling reactor technologies, such as the 235U initiated {FRs}. Additionally, a first-of-a-kind optimization scheme for the nuclear fuel cycle analysis is described. Optimization metrics of interest to different stakeholders in the fuel cycle (economics, fuel resource utilization, high-level waste, transuranic materials/proliferation management, and environmental impact) are utilized for two different optimization techniques: a linear one and a stochastic one. Stakeholder elicitation provided sets of relative weights for the identified metrics appropriate to each stakeholder group, which were then used to demonstrate feasibility of arrival at optimum fuel cycle configurations for recycling technologies. The stochastic optimization tool, based on a genetic algorithm, was used to identify noninferior solutions according to Pareto’s dominance approach to optimization. The main trade-off for fuel cycle optimization was found to be between emphasizing economics versus most of the other identified metrics.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
The options for used nuclear fuel storage location and affected parameters such as economic liabilities are currently a focus of several high level studies. A variety of nuclear fuel cycle system analysis models are available for such a task. The application of nuclear fuel cycle system dynamics models for waste management options is important to life-cycle impact assessment. 
 
The recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Committee on America’s Nuclear Future led to increased focus on long periods of spent fuel storage [1]. This motivated further investigation of the location dependency of used nuclear fuel in the parameters of economics, environmental impact, and proliferation risk. 
 
Through a review of available literature and interactions with each of the programs available, comparisons of post-reactor fuel storage and handling options will be evaluated based on the aforementioned parameters and a consensus of preferred system metrics and boundary conditions will be provided. Specifically, three options of local, regional, and national storage were studied. The preliminary product of this research is the creation of a system dynamics tool known as the Waste Management Module ({WMM}) which provides an easy to use interface for education on fuel cycle waste management economic impacts. Initial results of baseline cases point to positive benefits of regional storage locations with local regional storage options continuing to offer the lowest cost.},

	url = {https://escholarship.org/uc/item/26c5k0tq},
	shorttitle = {{FW}/{CADIS}-Ω},
	abstract = {The development of methods for deep-penetration radiation transport is of continued importance for radiation shielding, nonproliferation, nuclear threat reduction, and medical applications. As these applications become more ubiquitous, the need for transport methods that can accurately and reliably model the systems’ behavior will persist. For these types of systems, hybrid methods are often the best choice to obtain a reliable answer in a short amount of time. Hybrid methods leverage the speed and uniform uncertainty distribution of a deterministic solution to bias Monte Carlo transport to reduce the variance in the solution. At present, the Consistent Adjoint-Driven Importance Sampling ({CADIS}) and Forward-Weighted {CADIS} ({FW}-{CADIS}) hybrid methods are the gold standard by which to model systems that have deeply-penetrating radiation. They use an adjoint scalar flux to generate variance reduction parameters for Monte Carlo. However, in problems where there exists strong anisotropy in the flux, {CADIS} and {FW}-{CADIS} are not as effective at reducing the problem variance as isotropic problems.This dissertation covers the theoretical background, implementation of, and characteri- zation of a set of angle-informed hybrid methods that can be applied to strongly anisotropic deep-penetration radiation transport problems. These methods use a forward-weighted adjoint angular flux to generate variance reduction parameters for Monte Carlo. As a result, they leverage both adjoint and contributon theory for variance reduction. They have been named {CADIS}-Ω and {FW}-{CADIS}-Ω.To characterize {CADIS}-Ω, several characterization problems with flux anisotropies were devised. These problems contain different physical mechanisms by which flux anisotropy is induced. Additionally, a series of novel anisotropy metrics by which to quantify flux anisotropy are used to characterize the methods beyond standard Figure of Merit ({FOM}) and relative error metrics. As a result, a more thorough investigation into the effects of anisotropy and the degree of anisotropy on Monte Carlo convergence is possible.The results from the characterization of {CADIS}-Ω show that it performs best in strongly anisotropic problems that have preferential particle flowpaths, but only if the flowpaths are not comprised of air. Further, the characterization of the method’s sensitivity to deterministic angular discretization showed that {CADIS}-Ω has less sensitivity to discretization than {CADIS} for both quadrature order and {PN} order. However, more variation in the results were observed in response to changing quadrature order than {PN} order. Further, as a result of the forward-normalization in the Ω-methods, ray effect mitigation was observed in many of the characterization problems.The characterization of the {CADIS}-Ω-method in this dissertation serves to outline a path forward for further hybrid methods development. In particular, the response that the Ω- method has with changes in quadrature order, {PN} order, and on ray effect mitigation are strong indicators that the method is more resilient than its predecessors to strong anisotropies in the flux. With further method characterization, the full potential of the Ω-methods can be realized. The method can then be applied to geometrically complex, materially diverse problems and help to advance system modelling in deep-penetration radiation transport problems with strong anisotropies in the flux.},

The code package, {ROMUSE} (Reduced Order Modeling based Uncertainty/Sensitivity Estimator) is an effort to provide an analysis tool to be used in conjunction with reactor core simulators, in particular the Virtual Environment for Reactor Applications ({VERA}) core simulator. {ROMUSE} has been written in C++ and is currently capable of performing various types of parameter perturbations and associated sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification, surrogate model construction and subspace analysis. The current version 2.0 has the capability to interface with the Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications ({DAKOTA}) code, which gives {ROMUSE} access to the various algorithms implemented within {DAKOTA}, most importantly model calibration. The verification study is performed via two basic problems and two reactor physics models. The first problem is used to verify the {ROMUSE} single physics gradient-based range finding algorithm capability using an abstract quadratic model. The second problem is the Brusselator problem, which is a coupled problem representative of multi-physics problems. This problem is used to test the capability of constructing surrogates via {ROMUSE}-{DAKOTA}. Finally, light water reactor pin cell and sodium-cooled fast reactor fuel assembly problems are simulated via {SCALE} 6.1 to test {ROMUSE} capability for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis purposes.},

	abstract = {Compressible fluid dynamics is of great practical interest in many industrial applications, ranging from chemistry to aeronautical industry, and to nuclear field as well. At the same time, modelling and simulation of compressible flows is a very complex task, requiring the development of specific approaches, in order to describe the effect of pressure on the fluid velocity field. Compressibility effects become even more important in the study of two-phase flows, due to the presence of a gaseous phase. In addition, compressibility is also expected to have a significant impact on other physics, such as chemical or nuclear reactions occurring in the mixture. In this perspective, multiphysics represents a useful approach to address this complex problem, providing a way to catch all the different physics that come into play as well as the coupling between them. In this work, a multiphysics model is developed for the analysis of the generation {IV} Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}), with a specific focus on the compressibility effects of the fluid that acts as fuel in the reactor. The fuel mixture compressibility is expected to have an important effect on the system dynamics, especially in very rapid super-prompt-critical transients. In addition, the presence of a helium bubbling system used for online fission product removal could modify the fuel mixture compressibility, further affecting the system transient behaviour. Therefore, the {MSFR} represents an application of concrete interest, inherent to the analysis of compressibility effects and to the development of suitable modelling approaches. An {OpenFOAM} solver is developed to handle the fuel compressibility, the presence of gas bubbles in the reactor as well as the coupling between the system neutronics and fluid dynamics. The outcomes of this analysis point out that the fuel compressibility plays a crucial role in the evolution of fast transients, introducing delays in the expansion feedbacks that strongly affect the system dynamics. Moreover, it is found that the gas bubbles significantly alter the fuel compressibility, yielding even larger differences compared to the incompressible approximation usually adopted in the current {MSFR} solvers.},

	abstract = {India is developing thorium-based nuclear technologies with the aim to introduce them in its energy mix that is sustainable in the long term. Various reactor systems based on thorium fuel cycle are being developed. These include (i) thorium utilization in existing reactors ({PHWRs}), (ii) advanced heavy water reactor ({AHWR}), (iii) metallic-fueled reactors (fast/thermal), and (iv) molten salt reactor ({MSR}). Different fuel forms being studied include oxides/carbides, metallic alloys, and fluoride salts. Comprehensive information on the physicochemical properties of fuel is a primary input as required by reactor engineers and safety analysts to predict its performance under normal/off-normal reactor operation scenarios. The variable parameters essentially include temperature, composition, microstructure, and radiation field. A reliable database on thermophysical, thermochemical, and thermodynamic properties of fuel and related materials is therefore essential. This chapter presents an overview of R\&D efforts in this direction carried out at Chemistry Group of Bhabha Atomic Research Centre ({BARC}). Important results and their implications in terms of fuel’s performance potential are highlighted. While understanding of thorium-based oxide fuels (Th-U {MOX}, Th–Ce {MOX}, and {SIMFUELS}) has attained reasonable maturity, exciting potential of thorium-based in metallic fuel and fluoride salt fuel is being unearthed with recent experimental work. Few results on thorium-based metallic alloys are also presented. To conclude, glimpses of research efforts on thorium-based fluoride salts for Indian molten salt breeder reactor ({IMSBR}) are outlined.},

The reactor concept adopts 90\% enriched annular {UO}2 rods as the fuel and He-Xe mixture as the coolant. The thermal power is converted into electric power through Brayton turbines. The neutron flux distributions of four selected reactor configurations with different control rod arrangement are calculated using Monte Carlo code. In addition, calculations with different combinations of inserted control rods are conducted to investigate their effects on the power profile. Results show that control rods arranged in the central region help reduce the neutron flux peak and the radial flux peaking factor. The outer control rods, however, show limited effects on the central power profile. Instead, they only affect the region of the control rod neighborhood. Besides, since the outer control rods will increase the radial peaking factor, they are better to be used as safety rods for emergency. Based on the calculation and analysis, three control strategy candidates are proposed considering power profile flattening and control flexibility.},

The molten-salt reactor experiment ({MSRE}) model was used to analyze the reliability of this method. The obtained flow losses of reactivity for 235U and 233U fuels in the {MSRE} are 223 pcm and 100.8 pcm, respectively, which are in good agreement with the experimental values (212 pcm and 100.5 pcm, respectively). Then, six groups of effective delayed neutron fractions in a small molten salt reactor were calculated under different mass flow rates. The flow loss of reactivity at full power operation is approximately 105.6 pcm, which is significantly lower than that of the {MSRE} due to the longer residence time inside the active core. The sensitivity of the reactivity loss to other factors, such as the residence time inside or outside the core and flow distribution, was evaluated as well. As a conclusion, the sensitivity of the reactivity loss to the residence time inside the core is greater than to other parameters.},

	abstract = {Growing concerns over the impact of fossil fuels on climate change have driven efforts to find sources of energy with low emissions. In response, fluctuating renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, are growing to meet more of the electricity demand. However, maintaining reliable energy accessibility to the grid requires a stable, nonfluctuating source of power. Nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) provide nearly emissions-free, reliable energy to the grid (refer to “{IPCC} Fifth Assessment Report,” Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/). To best reduce reliance on fossil fuels while ensuring reliable energy generation and profitability, nuclear renewable hybrid energy systems ({NRHESs}) focus on tightly coupling renewable generation with a {NPP} by colocating the generation sources in an industrial park. The industrial park consists of at least the {NPP}, the renewable energy source, and some form of industrial process that consumes the energy not used by the grid. In this paper, we analyze the computational modeling approaches currently being pursued for {NRHESs}. We further investigate similarities between nuclear fuel cycle simulators ({NFCSs}) and {NRHESs} to determine how {NRHES} development can benefit from the development of {NFCSs}. This paper begins by reviewing past research on {NRHESs} to determine the necessary functionality of modeling software. After determining the necessary software capabilities for an {NRHES} model, we discuss the characteristics of a {NFCS}. The characteristics found common to both systems include desirability of a flexible modular design; open source; ability to be coupled to external pieces of software, including economic modeling, optimization methods, and sensitivity analysis; and results that are usable to technical and nontechnical people alike.},

	abstract = {{CRIEPI} and Toshiba Corp. have been exploring to realize a small-sized nuclear reactor for the needs of dispersed energy source and multi-purpose reactor. A conceptual design of 4S (Super-Safe, Small and Simple) reactor is proposed to meet the following design requirements: (1) All temperature feedback reactivity coefficients including whole core sodium void reactivity are negative; (2) The core integrity is secured against all anticipated transient without reactor scram; (3) No emergency power nor active mitigating system is required; (4) The reactivity core lifetime is more than 10 years. The 4S reactor is a metallic fueled sodium cooled fast reactor. A target of an electrical output is 10–50 {MW}. A remarkable feature of 4S is that its reactivity is not controlled by neutron absorber rods but by neutron reflectors to cope with a long core lifetime and a negative coolant void reactivity. This study includes a design consideration of 4S. Design discussions are mainly focused on various core designs to meet above requirements. A tall core active height is adopted to gain long core lifetime. An averaged fuel burn-up is tried to be increased up to 100 {GWd}/ton from a point of economic view. The reference 4S designs are 10 {MWe} (30 years core lifetime) and 50 {MWe} (10 years core lifetime).},

	abstract = {Sustainability of a nuclear fuel cycle can be strongly increased by fuel recycling. Not all reactor types have sufficient neutron economy to enable this recycling. Nevertheless, even if the neutron economy is not sufficient, simulation of repetitive recycling, with constant imposed power and fuel cycle parameters, results in converged fuel composition. The final equilibrium state represents an eigenvalue of the respective Bateman equations and strongly differs between the reactor types. Equilibrium reactivity, as a product of the neutron spectrum and fuel composition, determines inherent neutron economy of the reactor and thus its potential for closed fuel cycle and legacy waste burning. In this study the performance of sixteen selected reactor types, eight thermal and eight fast, was evaluated in both U-Pu and Th-U equilibrium fuel cycles. The reactor types were selected so that all major designs and spectra are covered. Even though the equilibrium composition and spectrum mutually influence each other, the general spectrum shape is determined by the relative strength of coolant and structural materials scattering properties. {EQL}0D v2 {MATLAB} procedure coupled to the {SERPENT} 2 code was used for the simulation. Several simplifying assumptions have been applied to enumerate the eigenvector of Bateman matrix; the reprocessing losses were zero, the {FPs} were neglected and instantaneously replaced by either 238U or 232Th feed, the reactors were represented only by an infinite lattice, and the generated power was fixed at nominal value independently from the criticality or subcriticality level and fissile fuel share. In the obtained equilibrium closed cycle every core acts, per definition, as an iso-breeder. Burned and produced masses are the same for each isotope. As expected, some of the reactors are subcritical and thus cannot be operated with such a fuel cycle in reality. Still the obtained eigenvalues well characterize each reactor performance. To provide additional insight into the equilibrium behavior unique reactivity break-down method was applied. Furthermore, two options for equilibrium reactivity increase were discussed and two major safety related parameters evaluated. The general conclusion of this study is that the U-Pu cycle profits more from the spectrum hardening and has better neutron economy, where more neutrons are produced but also parasitically captured. On the other hand, the Th-U cycle is less sensitive to the spectrum hardening and has better neutron efficiency, where the lower neutron production is compensated by the lower parasitic captures.},

	abstract = {A concept of molten salt fast reactor ({MSFR}) was proposed in {EVOL} to burn transuranium element discharged from pressurized water reactors. {MSFR} is featured by fast spectrum and using liquid fuel salt containing {UF}4 or {ThF}4. Some issues are presented, for instance, global material arrangement affects the local neutron spectrum due to long neutron free path, and fluoride salt ({LiF}-{BeF}2) has nonnegligible thermal neutron scattering effect. Thus, lattice code prepared for thermal-spectrum reactor is not suitable for {MSFR} calculation. In this study, “two-step” calculation scheme combining Monte Carlo method and deterministic method was prepared for {MSFR} calculation. A tool named {TRANS} was developed to transfer tally data from an open source Monte Carlo code {OpenMC} into few-group homogenized cross-sections, and one benchmark based on pressurized water reactor and two types of model based on {MSFR} were used for verification. Besides, the applicability of few-group parameters generated by different model to {MSFR} whole-core calculation was analyzed. Finally, {MSFR} neutronics characteristics at steady-state were calculated using {MOREL}. The results show that the few-group parameters generated by one-dimension (1D) and two-dimension (2D) model are correct, and it is feasible to use {OpenMC} to generate few-group parameters. In case of 1D homogenization model, few-group parameters by 1D model (b) can give more accurate results both for eigenvalue and flux distribution. In {MSFR} whole-core calculation, using few-group cross-sections generated by 2D model has better accuracy in flux distribution, however, using few-group cross-sections generated by 1D model has better accuracy in keff calculation. Moreover, the neutronics parameters of {MSFR} calculated by {MOREL} code agree well with that by other institutes.},

In this work, the simplified performance analysis code for the {KALIMER}-600 was developed and the power maneuvering characteristics without control rod movement was evaluated. We developed the analysis code by modifying a commercial Modular Modeling System ({MMS}) code. We attached the library for the properties of sodium as an additional user library and modified some component modules such as the fuel and pipehx with specific features of {KALIMER}-600. Then, the power maneuvering capability without control rod movement was evaluated when the {BOP} (balance of plant) power was changed. We called the power maneuvering capability with inherent reactivity feedback mechanism without control rod movement as self-control. We, in turn, evaluated the self-control capability under varied and/or fixed the flow rate of the coolant systems of the plant. We concluded the {KALIMER}-600 had a good self-control capability and some data obtained from this study would be used in developing control rod programming and flow rate programming of plant during power maneuvering.},

In this paper, the feedback coefficient and the breeding ratio are optimized based on the fuel-to-graphite ratio variation for a thorium based {MSR} ({TMSR}). A certain thermal core with negative feedback coefficient and relative high initial breeding ratio is chosen for the reprocessing scheme analysis. The breeding performances for the {TMSR} under different online fuel reprocessing efficiencies and frequencies are evaluated and compared with other {MSR} concepts. The results indicate that the thermal {TMSR} can get a breeding ratio greater than 1.0 with appropriate reprocessing scheme. The low fissile inventory in thermal {TMSR} leads to a short doubling time and low transuranic ({TRU}) inventory. The lifetime of graphite used for the {TMSR} is also discussed.},

	abstract = {This project defines a micro-scale nuclear battery ({MsNB}) as a nuclear (fission) heat source
capable of providing heat to power a small commercial gas turbine on the order of 5 {MWe}.
Currently, several molten salt reactor designs are actively being pursued; however, most share
two design features that provide design and operational complexity: pumps to circulate the
reactor molten salt (i.e., primary flow, and several stages of conventional tube and shell type heat
exchangers and associated circulating pumps). The {MicroNuclear} team embraced the challenges
associated with pumps and heat exchanger design, and developed an alternative reactor
configuration that accomplishes the objective of design simplification. The ansatz of the
proposed concept will (1) eliminate pumps by providing a natural circulation primary flow
design and (2) eliminate heat exchanger tubes with the application of passive heat pipes. The
configuration of this reactor design is an entirely novel concept.
{MicroNuclear} will collaborate with Idaho National Laboratory to expand development of the
{MsNB} concept. Preliminary analyses indicate the fundamental efficacy of the concept in terms of
{MsNB} size/scale from steady state neutronics calculations, natural circulation and heat transfer
estimates. Further refined computational analyses are required to advance the technical
understanding and to assess technology readiness level for this concept.},

	abstract = {Gravitational wave detection requires a detailed understanding of the response of the {LIGO} and Virgo detectors to true signals in the presence of environmental and instrumental noise. Of particular interest is the study of anomalous non-Gaussian transients, such as glitches, since their occurrence rate in {LIGO} and Virgo data can obscure or even mimic true gravitational wave signals. Therefore, successfully identifying and excising these anomalies from gravitational wave data is of utmost importance for the detection and characterization of true signals and for the accurate computation of their significance. To facilitate this work, we present the first application of deep learning combined with transfer learning to show that knowledge from pretrained models for real-world object recognition can be transferred for classifying spectrograms of glitches. To showcase this new method, we use a data set of twenty-two classes of glitches, curated and labeled by the Gravity Spy project using data collected during {LIGO}’s first discovery campaign. We demonstrate that our Deep Transfer Learning method enables an optimal use of very deep convolutional neural networks for glitch classification given small and unbalanced training data sets, significantly reduces the training time, and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy above 98.8\%, lowering the previous error rate by over 60\%. More importantly, once trained via transfer learning on the known classes, we show that our neural networks can be truncated and used as feature extractors for unsupervised clustering to automatically group together new unknown classes of glitches and anomalous signals. This novel capability is of paramount importance to identify and remove new types of glitches which will occur as the {LIGO}/Virgo detectors gradually attain design sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactor ({MSR}) shows great promise of high thermal-electric conversion efficiency, inherent safety, and on-line reprocessing. Furthermore, fuel breeding can be realized in both thermal and fast spectrum reactors with Th-U fuel cycle, which can make use of the abundant resource of thorium. In order to combine the advantages of high breeding ratio ({BR}) in fast spectrum and low fissile inventory for criticality in thermal spectrum, a single-fluid double-zone thorium-based molten salt reactor ({SD}-{TMSR}) core configuration is proposed. First, assemblies in both the inner and the outer zones are optimized by adjusting the ratios of molten salt and graphite with consideration of {BR}, 233U inventory, double time ({DT}), and temperature coefficient of reactivity ({TCR}) at the startup time, aiming to have a minimal {DT} for fuel breeding and a negative {TCR} for security. The results show that {DT} has the optimum value when the ratios of molten salt and graphite in the inner zone and the outer zone are 0.357 and 1.162, respectively. And the {TCR} can be improved to −2 pcm/K when the side length of the graphite hexagonal prism is 7.5 cm. Then, based on the optimized geometry, the burn-up calculations with a series of on-line reprocessing rates are carried out with a self-developed {MSR} reprocessing sequence ({MSR}-{RS}). The results show that on-line reprocessing is beneficial to the Th-U fuel breeding. When the reprocessing rate is 200 l/d, iso-breeding can be achieved. When the reprocessing rate is 5 m3/d, the performance of Th-U breeding is improved significantly, and only 16 years is needed for the 233U doubling. The results also show that {TCR} remains negative and inherent safety is satisfied during all the operation time.},

To contribute to this, in the present study, three electricity supply scenarios for 2030 are proposed according to different future nuclear power development policies, and the maximum penetration of renewable energy generation is pursued. On the other side of the equation, three electricity demand scenarios are also proposed considering potential energy saving measures. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate quantitatively the technological, economic and environmental impacts of different supply policy selections and demand assumptions on future electricity systems. The scenario analysis is conducted using an inputeoutput hour-by-hour simulation model subject to constraints from technological, economic and environmental perspectives. The obtained installed capacity mix, power generation mix, {CO}2 emissions, and generation cost of the scenarios were inter-compared and analyzed. The penetration of renewable energy generation in a future electricity system in Japan, as well as its relationship with nuclear power share was uncovered.},

The research ﬁnds that the generation costs of an onshore wind farm are between 4.5 and 8.7 scent/{kWh}; 6–11.1 scent/{kWh} when located offshore, with the number of full hours and the level of capital cost being the most inﬂuencing elements. Generation costs have increased by more than 20\% over the last 3 years mainly due to a rise of the price of certain strategic raw materials at a time when the global demand has boomed. However, the competitive position of wind energy investments vis-a` -vis other technologies has not been altered. In the long-term, one would expect production costs go down; whether this will be enough to offset the higher price of inputs will largely depend on the application of correct policies, like R\&D in new materials, O\&M with remote-control devices, offshore wind turbines and substructures; introduction of advanced siting and forecasting techniques; access to adequate funding; and long-term legal stability.},

	abstract = {The paper presents numerical predictions of various turbulent shear flows in which the structure of the viscous sublayer exerts appreciable influence on the flow. The model of turbulence employed is one where the turbulence energy and its dissipation rate are calculated by way of transport equations which are solved simultaneously with the conservation equations for the mean flow. The flows considered include isothermal low Reynolds number pipe flows, and wall boundary layers with streamwise pressure gradient and wall injection; the predictions span both natural transition and laminarisation. Although complete agreement with experiment is not yet achieved in every case, it is argued that only a turbulence model of (at least) this level of complexity will permit a universal modelling of the near-wall turbulence structures commonly found in thermal power equipment. L'article présente des estimations numériques de divers écoulements turbulents dans lesquels la structure de la sous-couche visqueuse exerce une influence notable sur l'écoulement. On a employé un modèle de turbulence o l'énergie de turbulence et son taux de dissipation sont calculés à l'aide des équations de transport résolues simultanément avec les équations de conservation pour l'écoulement moyen. Les écoulements considérés comprennent les écoulements isothermes en conduite à faibles nombres de Reynolds, les couches limites de paroi avec un gradient de pression dans le sens de l'écoulement et l'injection à la paroi. Les estimations concernent à la fois la transition naturelle et la laminarisation. Bien qu'un accord complet avec l'expérience ne soit pas encore obtenu on prouve qu'un tel modèle de turbulence avec ce niveau minimal de complexité permettra seulement une modélisation universelle des structures de turbulence près de la paroi communément réalisées dans les équipements thermiques. Die Veröffentlichung bringt numerische Berechnungen über verschiedene turbulente Strömungen, in denen die Struktur der viskosen Unterschicht beträchtlichen Einfluss auf die Strömung ausübt. Im zugrundegelegten Turbulenzmodell wird die Turbulenzenergie und deren Dissipationsanteil über die Transportgleichungen berechnet und zusammen mit den Erhaltungsgleichungen für die Hauptströmung gelöst. Die betrachteten Strömungen umfassen isotherme Rohrströmungen mit niedrigen Reynolds-Zahlen und Wandgrenzschichten mit Druckgradienten in Strömungsrichtung und Wandeinspritzung; die Voraussagen umspannen natürlichen Übergang und Laminarisation. Obwohl {vollständigeÜbereinstimmung} mit dem Experiment noch nicht in jedem Fall erreicht ist, wird dargelegt, dass nur ein Turbulenzmodell von (mindestens) diesem Verwicklungsniveau ein allgemeines Erfassen der Turbulenzstrukturen nahe der Wand, wie sie gewöhnlich bei thermischen Problemen auftreten, erlaubt.

With the worldwide increase in wind power during the past several years, there is increasing interest and significance regarding its capacity value. This has a direct influence on the amount of other (non-wind) capacity that is needed in future power systems. Recent work that evaluates the impact of multiple-year data sets and the impact of interconnected systems on resource adequacy. We also provide examples that explore the use of alternative reliability metrics for wind capacity value calculations. We show how multiple-year data sets significantly increase the robustness of results compared to single-year assessments. Assumptions regarding the transmission interconnections play a significant role. Results to date regarding which reliability metric to use for probabilistic capacity valuation show little sensitivity to the metric.},

	abstract = {The capacity credit for a generator is the fraction of its nameplate capacity that can contribute to meeting the system's resource adequacy. However, estimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy is challenging due to the variability, uncertainty, and spatial diversity of the renewable resources. This study uses the Regional Energy Deployment System to quantify the impacts on the U.S. power sector through 2050 from misestimations of renewable capacity credit. Results show that small underestimates of the renewable capacity credit have little impact on system buildout, but that large underestimates ({\textgreater}50\%) can reduce solar photovoltaic deployment by nearly 100 {GW} (50\%) and wind by up to 43 {GW} (22.8\%) in 2030s. Such large differences are possible because the capacity credit for variable renewable energy can substantially impact the overall costs and value of variable renewable energy relative to other technologies. Such effects are most strongly felt in the mid-term but are less relevant over the long-term due to the declining value of variable resources. Underestimating the capacity credit of variable renewable energy leads to increased system costs and emissions. Conversely, overvaluing the capacity credit of variable renewable energy reduces system costs at the risk of lower reliability.

The present paper proposes a method to estimate the required amount of storage backup for a mostly solar and wind system that uses also biomass and hydroenergy as minor components of the electricity mix. An hourly simulation was carried out to determine the amount of electricity that could be produced based on the meteorological conditions of year 2001 in Japan, and this was compared with the maximum electricity demands imposed in the system for each month of the year. The system thus proposed has 100\% chance of meeting around 40\% of the electricity demand between 11:00 and 18:00, and the optimum scenario obtained (a 2:1 mix of solar to wind energy) required around 40TW of storage to balance the extra electricity demand that occurs during the summer in Japan. It appears unlikely that the batteries in {EV} in vehicles will be able to meet this storage requirement in the future, though the system is able to adequately meet the electricity demand during the majority of the year, and hence showcases the viability of renewable energy.},

By keeping a record of failure time for each subassembly of a wind turbine, maintenance could be more effectively targeted with more detail in terms of what is likely to fail. Failure data from a wind farm is analyzed as an example, which shows results predicted by the technique presented are close to the wind farm statistics.

	abstract = {This paper describes a method for quantifying wind farm availability using two different approaches and comparing the results. Wind turbine suppliers regularly guarantee turbine availability in terms of time. A typical value of 97\% is generally taken as the industry standard. This paper shows that this guarantee can potentially under-compensate the wind farm operator for losses sustained depending on when the period of non-availability occurs. Here we present an alternative method to quantify wind farm availability based on energy, which relates the energy losses in an Irish wind farm in 2007 to periods of turbine non-availability. It is shown in this analysis completed at this operational wind farm that while the technical non-availability as a percentage of time is 3\%, the percentage of energy lost during downtimes is actually 11\%. Based on the financial analysis above, the financial losses are significant. To answer the question should wind turbine availability be time or energy based, this paper shows that it can be advantageous for wind turbine owners to have energy-based calculations as long as the developers have sufficient monitoring of not only wind speed but also {SCADA} data.},

It is aimed to study and compare the performances of hydrogen production methods and assess their economic, social and environmental impacts, The methods considered in this study are natural gas steam reforming, coal gasiﬁcation, water electrolysis via wind and solar energies, biomass gasiﬁcation, thermochemical water splitting with a {CueCl} and {SeI} cycles, and high temperature electrolysis. Environmental impacts (global warming potential, {GWP} and acidiﬁcation potential, {AP}), production costs, energy and exergy efﬁciencies of these eight methods are compared. Furthermore, the relationship between plant capacity and hydrogen production capital cost is studied. The social cost of carbon concept is used to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. The results indicate that thermochemical water splitting with the Cu {eCl} and {SeI} cycles become more environmentally benign than the other traditional methods in terms of emissions. The options with wind, solar and high temperature electrolysis also provide environmentally attractive results. Electrolysis methods are found to be least attractive when production costs are considered. Therefore, increasing the efﬁciencies and hence decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar and wind electrolysis bring them forefront as potential options. The energy and exergy efﬁciency comparison study indicates the advantages of biomass gasiﬁcation over other methods. Overall rankings show that thermochemical {CueCl} and {SeI} cycles are primarily promising candidates to produce hydrogen in an environmentally benign and cost-effective way.},

The former is based on the point kinetics equations with six groups of delayed neutrons and the lumped capacitance heat transfer equations. To account for the reflector effect on neutron lifetime, additional (fictional) groups of delayed neutrons are added in the point kinetics equations to represent the thermalized neutrons coming back from the reflectors. The latter is based on coupled multi-group neutron diffusion and finite element heat transfer model. Multi-group cross sections and diffusion coefficients are generated using the Monte Carlo code Serpent and defined as input in {COMSOL} 5.0.},

	abstract = {The article presents a description and some illustrative results of the application of two optimization models for a two-component nuclear energy system consisting of thermal and fast reactors in a closed nuclear fuel cycle. These models correspond to two possible options of developing Russian nuclear energy system, which are discussed in the expert community: (1) thermal and fast reactors utilizing uranium and mixed oxide fuel, (2) thermal reactors utilizing uranium oxide fuel and fast reactors utilizing mixed nitride uranium-plutonium fuel. The optimization models elaborated using the {IAEA} {MESSAGE} energy planning tool make it possible not only to optimize the nuclear energy system structure according to the economic criterion, taking into account resource and infrastructural constraints, but also to be used as a basis for developing multi-objective, stochastic and robust optimization models of a two-component nuclear energy system. These models were elaborated in full compliance with the recommendations of the {IAEA}’s {PESS} and {INPRO} sections, regarding the specification of nuclear energy systems in {MESSAGE}. The study is based on publications of experts from {NRC} “Kurchatov Institute”, {JSC} “{SSC} {RF}-{IPPE}”, {ITCP} “Proryv”, {JSC} “{NIKIET}”. The presented results demonstrate the characteristic structural features of a two-component nuclear energy system for conservative assumptions in order to illustrate the capabilities of the developed optimization models. Consideration is also given to the economic feasibility of a technologically diversified nuclear energy structure providing the possibility of forming on its base a robust system in the future. It has been demonstrated that given the current uncertainties in the costs of nuclear fuel cycle services and reactor technologies, it is impossible at the moment to make a reasonable conclusion regarding the greatest attractiveness of a particular option in terms of the economic performance.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is the extension of a multiphysics {OpenFOAM} solver for the analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}), developed in previous works (Cervi et al., 2017, 2018). In particular, the neutronics sub-solver is improved by implementing a new module based on the {SP}3 approximation of the neutron transport equation. The new module is successfully tested against a Monte Carlo model of the {MSFR}, in order to assess its correct implementation. Then, a neutronics analysis of the {MSFR} is carried out on a simplified axial-symmetric model of the reactor. Particular focus is devoted to the analysis of the {MSFR} helium bubbling system and its effect on reactivity. The presence of bubbles inside the reactor is handled with a two-fluid thermal-hydraulics module, previously implemented into the solver. The void reactivity coefficient is evaluated on the basis of the bubble spatial distribution calculated by the multiphysics solver. Then, the results are compared to simulations carried out with uniform bubble distributions, highlighting significant differences between the two approaches. The outcomes of this work constitute a step forward in the multiphysics analysis of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor and represent a useful starting point for the optimization of the {MSFR} helium bubbling system, as well as for the development of appropriate control strategies.},

A centrifugal separator was used as the bubble separator, taking advantage of the kinetic energy of fluid to create a centrifugal force to separate gas bubbles from the mixture flow. Both the bubble generator and the separator were demonstrated to have good potential to meet the performance requirements of an off-gas removal system for a small {TMSR}. With water and air as the working fluids, for the final designs of the two key pieces of equipment, a liquid flow rate exceeding 15 m3/h can essentially make their performance meet the requirements of the off-gas removal system in terms of the average size of the generated bubbles and gas separation efficiency.},

	abstract = {In circulating fuel reactors, such as the Molten Salt Reactor, the fuel circulates throughout the reactor instead of being immobile as in solid fuel reactors. The vast majority of nuclear simulation codes are primarily designed to simulate solid fuel reactors. Hence, many features unique to circulating fuel reactors, such as fuel injection and removal, cannot be properly modeled with these codes. The work presented here focuses on developing a numerical simulation package that can effectively and accurately model these reactors. This package consists of the coupling of the Monte Carlo particle transport code {OpenMC} with a modified version of {ORIGEN}-S, and uses a novel algorithm that calculates the optimal fuel injection and removal schemes for such reactors to achieve certain conditions such as a stable reactivity. We demonstrate our code’s accuracy by benchmarking the coupling module with the {MCODE} coupling code, and by simulating the operation of the {ORNL} Denatured Molten Salt Reactor using the coupling and fuel injection modules. The resulting fuel injection scheme is in agreement with the original study of that reactor while offering a much finer resolution for the injection scheme over time. This work is part of a broader project to develop an open-source neutronics code for circulating fuel reactors that will couple {OpenMC} with an in-house open-source depletion module.},

	abstract = {Nuclear fuel cycle and nuclear waste disposal decisions are technologically coupled. However, current nuclear fuel cycle simulators lack dynamic repository performance analysis due to the computational burden of high-fidelity hydrolgic contaminant transport models. The Cyder disposal environment and repository module was developed to fill this gap. It implements medium-fidelity hydrologic radionuclide transport models to support assessment appropriate for fuel cycle simulation in the Cyclus fuel cycle simulator. Rapid modeling of hundreds of discrete waste packages in a geologic environment is enabled within this module by a suite of four closed form models for advective, dispersive, coupled, and idealized contaminant transport: a Degradation Rate model, a Mixed Cell model, a Lumped Parameter model, and a 1-D Permeable Porous Medium model. A summary of the Cyder module, its timestepping algorithm, and the mathematical models implemented within it are presented. Additionally, parametric demonstrations simulations performed with Cyder are presented and shown to demonstrate functional agreement with parametric simulations conducted in a standalone hydrologic transport model, the Clay Generic Disposal System Model developed by the Used Fuel Disposition Campaign Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy.},

Finally, drift of delayed neutron precursors must be incorporated into the kinetics analysis due to the mobility of the liquid fuel. This talk will discuss all three components. Toward the first component, a discussion of the {SaltProc} python package will establish the fuel composition dynamics capabilities necessary for fuel composition depletion in the context of online reprocessing. Toward the second component, a point kinetics model implementation in {PyRK}, and a more sophisticated advection model implementation in Moltres will be discussed. Finally, incorporation in Moltres of neutron diffusion and precursor equations will be discussed as will their implementation using the {MOOSE} action system.},

However, most contemporary nuclear reactor physics software is unable to perform high-fidelity full-core depletion calculations for a reactor design with online reprocessing.

In the 21st century, the world faces the novel challenge of drastically reducing emissions of greenhouse gases while simultaneously expanding energy access and economic opportunity to billions of people. We examine this challenge in the electricity sector, which has been widely identified as an early candidate for deep decarbonization. In most regions, serving the projected electricity demand in 2050 while simultaneously reducing emissions will require a mix of electrical generation assets different from the current system. Although a variety of low- or zero-carbon technologies can be employed, our analysis demonstrates the potential contribution nuclear can make as a dispatchable low-carbon technology. The least-cost portfolios in our analysis include an important share for nuclear, the magnitude of which grows significantly as its cost drops. Therefore, there are strong incentives for industry to reduce the cost of new nuclear plants, and here we identify promising approaches for achieving such cost reductions. We recommend that governments create policies that equally recognize the environmental and societal benefits of all low-carbon energy technologies. Without a balanced portfolio of dispatchable and variable energy sources, the cost and difficulty of achieving decarbonization targets increases significantly.},

Here, we discuss each of these three areas, bringing diverse information sources together into one paper, and summarising important advances made in recent years, with the goal of strengthening {CCS} cost engineering and economic analysis in general. The first part of the paper discusses equipment design and sizing; cost indices and location factors; process and project contingency costs; {CO}2 transport and storage costs; and uncertainty analysis and validation. The second part discusses new insights and advances in capture plant integration costs; the costs of steam supply; flexible dispatch of power plants with {CCS}; a hybrid method for the costing of advanced {CCS} technologies; qualitative uncertainty analysis methods; and calculation methods for {CO}2 avoidance costs in non-power industries. The third part highlights several recent changes in the policy environments and how they affect the requirements of {CCS} costing studies. We close the paper by echoing earlier calls for the transparent reporting of assumptions and input variables underlying costing studies and by prioritising three {CCS} costing issues for further methods and guideline development.},

	abstract = {To enhance the understanding of thermal impact on the in situ behaviour of the Callovo–Oxfordian argillite, this paper presents an interpretation of an in situ heating experiment carried out in the Meuse/Haute Marne Underground Research Laboratory (M/{HM} {URL}). The argillite was heated successively by two constant heating powers: 277 W and 925 W. When subjected to thermal loading, the argillite exhibits an important volume change and a strong pore pressure response that signiﬁcantly affect its hydraulic and mechanical behaviour. Numerical analysis has been performed by using a coupled theoretical formulation that incorporates a constitutive model especially developed for this material. Based on Biot's theory, this model includes the inﬂuence of interstitial pressure on the mechanical behaviour. The simulation obtained reproduces satisfactorily the results of the in situ experiment and the main observed patterns of behaviour. The interpretation and discussion of numerical results provide additional data that can help us to understand the thermo-hydromechanical behaviour concepts of saturated argillite formation.},

	abstract = {With a view to providing supportive information for the decision-making on the direction of the future nuclear energy systems in Korea (i.e., direct disposal or recycling of spent nuclear fuel) to be made around 2020, quantitative studies on the spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) including transuranic elements ({TRUs}) and a series of economic analyses were conducted. At first, the total isotopic inventory of {TRUs} in the {SNF} to be generated from all thirty-six units of nuclear power plants in operation or under planning is estimated based on the Korean government’s official plan for nuclear power development. Secondly, the optimized deployment strategies are proposed considering the minimum number of sodium cooled-fast reactors ({SFRs}) needed to transmute all {TRUs}. Finally, direct disposal and Pyro-{SFR} closed nuclear energy systems were compared using equilibrium economic model and considering reduction of {TRUs} and electricity generation as benefits. Probabilistic economic analysis shows that the assumed total generation cost for direct disposal and Pyro-{SFR} closed nuclear energy systems resides within the range of 13.60{\textasciitilde}33.94 mills/{kWh} and 11.40{\textasciitilde}25.91 mills/{kWh}, respectively. Dominant cost elements and the range of {SFR} overnight cost which guarantees the economic feasibility of the Pyro-{SFR} closed nuclear energy system over the direct disposal option were also identified through sensitivity analysis and break-even cost estimation.},

	abstract = {Numerous studies have attempted to solve the problems constraining the sustainable utilization of nuclear power, for example, the already accumulated {HLWs}, the worsening environment due to greenhouse emissions, the questionable reliability of natural uranium resources, and the argument over nuclear safety, which are certainly top issues to be addressed. A well-organized nuclear fuel cycle system is the basis for nuclear power sustainability. Therefore, which type of reactor to be employed and whether or not to adopt a reprocessing technique for spent fuel are two key issues to be addressed. A Sodium Fast Reactor ({SFR}), a Generation {IV} reactor, has gained considerable attention worldwide. {SFR} recycling coupled to pyroprocessing, a so-called Pyro-{SFR} Recycling, shows promising advantages, and therefore, this paper focuses on exploring a strategy of how to realize it, which can offer informative procedures for a better use of nuclear power. A dynamic model has been developed to quantitatively analyze a country-specific case employing two scenarios, a once-through and Pyro-{SFR}, for a comprehensive comparison, especially focusing on the uranium utilization, the {HLW} reduction, and the electricity generation cost.},

	abstract = {Fluoride High-temperature Reactors ({FHRs}) are regarded for their high temperature output and passive decay heat rejection. Small Modular Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({SmAHTR}), a 125 {MWth} reactor falls under the {FHR} group. Along with {FHRs}, {SmAHTR} also uses multilayered, high accident tolerant {TRistructural} {ISOtropic} ({TRISO}) fuel kernels. Despite the reactor’s benefits due to its high efficiency and safety parameters, its considerably higher fuel costs compared to traditional {UO}2 fuel creates a drawback. To mitigate this problem and use the fuel more efficiently, lower fraction of fuel can be loaded into the core, however the resulting cycle length may be prohibitively short. This study proposes a spectral shift scheme to improve both the discharge burnup and the cycle length simultaneously for these types of reactors. Our analyses include both the neutronic and the thermal hydraulics (T/H) assessment for the non-spatial implementation of this scheme under single- and multi-batch scheme operation. The safety performance, i.e. reactivity coefficients and T/H limits, for this concept is comparable to the original design. The results confirm that performance benefits of more than 32\% compared to the original design are achievable.},

	abstract = {Recent interest in advanced reactors and the following need for techno-economic transitions has increased the demand for tools necessary to model complex nuclear fuel cycles ({NFCs}) and advanced reactor technologies. This thesis demonstrates the capability of {CYCLUS} , the agent-based fuel cycle simulator, to model, simulate, and analyze real-life fuel cycle transition scenarios. I introduce new methods and tools that use various databases to model and simulate real-world nuclear fuel cycle transition scenarios involving advanced reactor technologies.

The work in this thesis contains: (1) benchmarking Cyclus to other nuclear fuel cycle simulators ({NFC} simulators); (2) developing new methods and tools necessary for modeling and simulating real-world fuel cycle transition scenarios; (3) simulation of both domestic and international nuclear technology transitions.

The methods and tools developed for such capabilities include: (1) modeling and simulating past and current nuclear fleets using historic nuclear reactor operations database; (2) modeling individual reactors and their operating history to calculate nuclear material inventory; (3) modeling Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) behavior in a large-scale fuel cycle simulation.

Benchmark work shows that {CYCLUS} results coincide with results from other {NFC} simulators with minor differences due to modeling choices. Additionally, this thesis demonstrates the {CYCLUS} capability to effectively model and simulate real-life {NFC} transition scenarios that involve advanced reactor technologies such as {MSRs}.},

	title = {Investigation of Agricultural Uses of Nuclear Waste Heat. {UIUC} Technical Report. October, 2018.},
	abstract = {Nuclear power plants ({NPPs}) produce significant quantities of waste heat due to the low thermal efficiency of the Rankine cycle. This waste heat carries roughly two-thirds of the total power generated at a nuclear power plant. It is responsibly released to the environment as a warm water flow, carrying with it a massive amount of low-grade thermal energy. As of now, this energy is lost from all Exelon {NPPs}. This waste heat is essentially a free source of energy and utilization projects offer the potential to significantly increase the thermal efficiency and profitability of centralized power generating stations, in particular {NPPs}.
Agricultural projects, particularly climate-controlled greenhouses, may show the most dramatic benefit from waste-heat utilization. Due to the relatively low temperature requirements of greenhouses, heating costs may be eliminated or cut substantially by the implementation of waste heat. The technical readiness of coupling central power generation station’s waste heat discharge to climate-controlled greenhouses is high and has been demonstrated. Implementing this combined heat and power approach to Exelon’s fleet of {NPPs} could offer significant advantages over fossil fueled power plants due to their high capacity factor, and strictly controlled and monitored water discharge.   
Exelon {NPPs} at Braidwood, Byron, Dresden, and Calvert Cliffs hold potential to supply significant agricultural waste heat. Few regulations exist specific to the use of waste heat from {NPPs}, but the discharge of waste heat from {NPPs} is strictly regulated, mitigating potential for regulatory hurdles to its use in other industries. Waste heat from Exelon’s {NPPs} is an untapped and potentially lucrative commodity. In the Midwest, the location of Exelon’s {NPPs} offers interesting opportunities for waste heat use in agriculture. The cold Midwest climate is normally a limiting factor in crop diversity and heated greenhouses are an option for overcoming this issue, but the heating costs are a barrier themselves. With cooperation between growers and the Exelon Corporation, waste heat may be commoditized while also facilitating more efficient and diverse growing operations. Waste heat use is not limited to farming operations. There are a host of industries that can benefit from waste heat use that may be local to other power plants. The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant is located ideally to facilitate the farming of oysters with waste heat or even provide heat for liquefied natural gas vaporization. 
This report details a preliminary analysis to evaluate the potential for utilizing waste heat from {NPPs}. From the exhaustive review of past waste heat efforts, agricultural options, and primary economic and radiological factors, the technical readiness is shown to be high and the concept is sound. It is recommended that a detailed analysis should follow that includes: coupling candidate {NPPs} to specific greenhouse architectures, exploration of high-value crop options in prototypic and bounding event environments, and a detailed economic assessment.},

The statistical sampling method has been utilized for the uncertainty quantification, based on the conventional “two-step” scheme. First, the nuclear-data uncertainties are propagated to the few-group constants through the lattice modeling and simulations; and then the uncertainties of the key core parameters are quantified through the reactor modeling and simulations. As interests, the uncertainties have been quantified to the critical boron concentrations, axial-power offset and radial assembly-power distributions through the whole life of first cycle. From the numerical results, it can be observed that for the critical boron concentration, the nuclear-data introduced uncertainties can up to be 51 ppm as maximum; for the axial-power offset, the relative uncertainties vary within 1.3\% and for the radial assembly-power distributions, the maximum relative uncertainties is about 3.8\% at {BOL} and 0.8\% at {EOL}.},

In the safety evaluation of {IVR}-{ERVC}, thermal behavior of the corium pool has been determined using experimental correlations. Property differences between the experimental simulant and the corium have been considered negligible. The effect of property differences represented by Prandtl number (Pr) on the thermal behavior of oxide pool is numerically investigated. The algebraic heat flux model ({AFM}) is used to simulate the turbulent natural convection and is validated with the {BALI} experiment. The Pr effect on the flow characteristics and the thermal behavior is investigated in the high Rayleigh number region. The present results show that the upward heat transfer tends to increase at the same Ra′ in the case of the molten pool which is lower Pr fluid than the simulant material.},

	shorttitle = {Advanced online fuel reprocessing simulation for thorium-fueled molten salt breeder reactor},
	abstract = {Current interest in advanced nuclear energy and {MSR} concepts has enhanced demand in building the tools to analyze these systems. This thesis introduces a Python script, {SaltProc}, which simulates {MSR} online reprocessing by modeling the changing isotopic composition of an irradiated fuel salt. {SaltProc} couples with the Monte Carlo code, {SERPENT} 2, for neutron transport and depletion calculations. {SaltProc} capabilities include a generic geometry capable of modeling multi-region and multi-flow systems, time-dependent feeds and removals, and specific separation efficiency for each element or isotope removal flow. Generally applicable capabilities are illuminated in this thesis in three applied problems: (1) simulating the startup of a thorium-fueled {MSBR} fuel cycle to find equilibrium fuel composition (when multiplication factor of the full-core model and the U-233 concentration in the fuel salt are invariant in time); (2) determining the effect of the fuel salt irradiation with online reprocessing on {MSBR} operations; and (3) estimating {MSBR} fuel cycle performance by computing the Th-232 feed rate over 20 years of operation and comparing with available data. In the first application, full-core depletion in the {MSBR} demonstrated that (1) equilibrium fuel composition could be achieved after 16 years and (2) the multiplication factor stabilizes after 6 years of operation. In the second application, fuel salt irradiation with simulated fission product removal and fissile/fertile feed causes considerable neutron energy spectrum hardening; this spectral shift has a problematic impact on safety parameters (e.g., temperature reactivity feedback, reactivity control system worth). In the third application, the average Th-232 feed rate throughout 20 years of operation is 2.39 kg/day or 100 g/{GWh}(e) which is a good agreement with other recent research. Problematic effects of neutron energy spectrum hardening during {MSBR} operation should be taken into account for neutronics, multi-physics, and fuel cycle performance analysis.},

	abstract = {The Heavy Water moderated Molten Salt Reactor ({HW}-{MSR}) is a novel concept of a thermal heterogeneous nuclear reactor and pursues for Thorium-Uranium (Th-U) breeding. It adopts heavy water rather than graphite as moderator while employs the same liquid fuel of molten salt reactor ({MSR}). Thus this new concept inherits the positive properties of {MSR} (feasible for online reprocessing) and heavy water reactor (high neutron moderating ratio). Furthermore it can address the problems of depleted graphite management and positive temperature coefficient due to neutron spectral shift propitious to 233U fission existed in Molten Salt Breeding Reactor ({MSBR}). {HW}-{MSR} consists of the primary loop system, intermediate cooling loop, energy conversion system, external cooling system and online reprocessing system. Since there is a huge temperature difference between molten salt (higher than 600 °C) and heavy water (lower than 100 °C to keep high density) in the core, effectively preventing the heat transfer between them is one main challenge. To address this problem, a thermal insulator made of Yttria Stabilized Zirconia ({YSZ}) is applied and analyzed. The calculation results show that both the fuel salt and moderator outlet temperature across the core can satisfy the design requirements. Similar to a traditional {MSR}, the {HW}-{MSR} also implements an online reprocessing system which can online extract and recycle useful fuel during operation, providing a feasible approach for Th-U fuel cycle. In addition, because of the outstanding neutron performance of heavy water moderator, a small initial 233U loading mass is required for {HW}-{MSR}, and its breeding ratio can achieve 1.073, corresponding to a doubling time of 12 years at the reprocessing cycle of 10 days. Compared with traditional light water reactor ({LWR}) whose transuranium ({TRU}) production is 69 kg/{GWy}, {HW}-{MSR} produces only 0.51 kg/{GWy}. This much lower radiotoxicity of nuclear waste in the {HW}-{MSR} would significantly enhance the sustainability of nuclear energy.},

	url = {https://www.hydrogen.energy.gov/annual_progress17_storage.html},
	abstract = {The primary objective of this effort is to identify alloys
to replace Type 316/316L in hydrogen service for {BOP}
applications onboard fuel cell electric vehicles. Type 316/316L
austenitic stainless steels are used extensively in hydrogen
systems for their resistance to hydrogen embrittlement, which
is attributed to the relatively high nickel content of Type
316/316L alloys. Nickel content, however, drives the cost of
austenitic stainless steels, thus Type 316/316L alloys impose
a cost premium compared to similar alloys with lower nickel
content. Since the cost of {BOP} components is a large fraction
of the cost of hydrogen fuel systems (even dominating the
cost at low production volumes [1]), alternative materials are
desired. In addition, Type 316/316L alloys are relatively low
strength, thus high-pressure components tend to be heavy to
accommodate the stresses associated with the pressure loads.
Higher-strength materials enable reduction of weight of {BOP}
components and contribute to lower cost since less material
is needed. However, engineering data to justify selection
of lower cost and higher strength alloys for high-pressure
hydrogen service are currently unavailable.
Additionally, high-throughput computational materials
science has evolved to a level of sophistication that large
databases of composition can be screened based on
knowledge of sensitive performance metrics. While firstprinciples prediction of fatigue performance is still beyond
the capability of computational materials science, many
intrinsic behaviors of alloys can be predicted from first
principles. This effort uses stacking fault energy, which
can be calculated, as an indicator of resistance to hydrogen
embrittlement to screen large compositional space. Databases
of these calculations are combined into an interactive tool
where a user can assess multiple compositionally-sensitive
attributes to design new alloy compositions. In this case,
alloy compositions that optimize cost and hydrogen
resistance (through the stacking fault energy indicator).},

To perform the high fidelity multi-physics simulations of real reactors or benchmark calculations such as two-cycle {BEAVRS} benchmark based on measurement data of a practical nuclear power plant, several factors must be considered such as large scale detailed depletion, thermal-hydraulics feedback, on-the-fly nuclear cross section processing, criticality search and inter-cycle refueling. In this paper, the abilities mentioned above for multiple burnup cycles simulations in Hot Full Power condition of {PWR} full core have been developed in continuous-energy Reactor Monte Carlo neutron and photon transport code {RMC}, which is developed by Department of Engineering Physics at Tsinghua University, Beijing (Wang et al., 2015). {RMC} has the capacity for lifecycle simulations of nuclear reactor cores. The {BEAVRS} benchmark was selected as an example and {RMC} was applied to a full core, two cycle burnup calculation of {BEAVRS}. All of the parameters given in the {BEAVRS} benchmark have been calculated and compared with the measured values of {BEAVRS} benchmark. For other parameters such as pin power distributions, they are compared to the results of other codes. The results of {RMC} agree well with the measured values of {BEAVRS} benchmark and also agree well with those of other codes. This was the first time for a Monte Carlo code to perform the full core, two cycle calculation of {BEAVRS}. This work paves the way for Monte Carlo codes in life cycle simulations of nuclear reactor cores.},

	shorttitle = {{AEN}-{WPRS} {SFR}-{UAM}},
	abstract = {A series of benchmarks on which the different participants could compare their abilities to
calculate the nominal performance characteristics and the global safety parameters of Sodiumcooled Fast Reactor ({SFR}) cores was launched within the Working Party on Reactor and System
({WPRS}) under the {SFR}-{FT} task force. The work concentrated on two different core sizes: 2
large size cores (3600 {MW} thermal) and 2 medium size cores (1000 {MW} thermal), and three
types of fuel: oxide, carbide and metal. This comparative study focused on the following items:
 Neutronic characterization of global parameters (k-effective, power distributions, sodium
void worth, Doppler, etc.)
 Feedback coefficient evaluation, discussion and agreement on corresponding calculation
methodology.
This work is summarized in the final report [1] and confirmed the ability of participants and their
neutronic codes to provide generally consistent results when analyzing {SFR} core characteristics.
Some remaining inconsistencies with the results of some participants could not be investigated
and still need to be understood. In particular, discrepancies between “best estimate”
deterministic and Monte-Carlo results need to be investigated in depth in order to identify
remaining bias. Beyond this important task, the detailed review of modeling effects that was
performed in this first benchmark paved the way of important recommendations on general
neutronic schemes to be adopted for accurate reactivity effect evaluation using deterministic
codes:
 Heterogeneous spatial description of subassembly for cross section generation
 Fine group (few thousand group) energy description for self-shielding effects
 Specific treatment in order to take into account spatial self-shielding effect on control rod
cross section
The initial objectives of the {SFR}-{FT} benchmark also involved calculating the feedback
coefficients and simulating unprotected transients, but those could not be reached within this
initial framework. This is why a follow-on benchmark exercise hosted within the {UAM} group is
proposed in order to conduct the calculation of neutronic feedback coefficients and their
uncertainties at the End of Cycle ({EOC}). This benchmark proposal also includes in a second step
the analyses of unprotected transient. Two {SFR} cores among the 4 being studied in the {SFR}-{FT}
group were selected and are described in this document. Those are the large oxide core proposed
by {CEA} and the medium metallic core proposed by {ANL}. Since the remaining inconsistencies of
the previous benchmark were concentrated on the burnup calculations, the cores descriptions
proposed in this new benchmark are directly provided at the end of cycle in order to minimize
the sources of discrepancies dues to the different depletion codes used by the participants.
The neutronic feedback coefficients and their uncertainties at the end of cycle will be conducted
within the first step of this benchmark using a common calculation methodology detailed in this
document. In particular the axial and radial thermal expansion coefficients that were missing in
the previous benchmark exercise will be estimated. 
Based on the results obtained in the previous step, transient calculations will be performed on a
few selected cases for the principal unprotected transients: unprotected transient overpower
({UTOP}), unprotected loss of flow ({ULOF}), Unprotected Control Rod Withdrawal ({UCRW}) and
possibly in a later stage unprotected loss of heat sink ({ULOHS}).},

The new modeling approach is developed to help understand the dynamics of different parameters in the system. The first phase of this new modeling approach is focused on the fuel basket/salt interface and involves the transport of various species in the driver fuels (e.g. uranium and zirconium). This new approach minimizes the guessed parameters from three down to one, the exchange current density (i0). This new method should allow a rapid, accurate understanding of the {ER} process permitting predictions of different system designs. U3+ and Zr4+ were the only species used for the current study. The result reveals that potential for each species is the fixed variable, it is a function of weight percent (wt\%) of uranium in molten salts and is independent of i0. The dimensionless approach shows that the total potential is a strong function of i0 and a weak function of wt\% of uranium in the salt system.},

	abstract = {A unique pyrochemical process is being developed for separation of metallic nuclear fuel from fission products by electrotransport through molten {LiC}1-{KC}1 eutectic salt to solid and liquid metal cathodes. The process will allow recovery and reuse of essentially all of the actinides in spent fuel from the integral fast reactor ({IFR}) and disposal of wastes in satisfactory forms. Electrotransport is used to minimize reagent consumption and, consequently, waste volume. In particular, electrotransport to solid cathodes is used for recovery of an essentially pure uranium product in the presence of other actinides; removal of pure uranium is used to adjust the electrolyte composition in preparation for recovery of a plutoniumrich mixture with uranium in liquid cadmium cathodes. This paper presents (i) experiments that delineate the behavior of key actinide and rare-earth elements during electrotransport to a solid electrode over a useful range of {PuClJUC}13 ratios in the electrolyte, (if) a thermodynamic basis for that behavior, and (iii) a comparison of the observed behavior with that calculated from a thermodynamic model. This work clearly establishes that recovery of nearly pure uranium can be a key step in the overall pyrochemical-fuel-processing strategy for the {IFR}.},

	abstract = {{SafeGuards} Analysis ({SGA}) is a computational toolbox able to simulate different safeguards scenarios across a number of different fuel cycles and at many different scales within a Matlab Simulink framework.  {SGA} functions by simulating Material Balance Areas ({MBAs}) under safeguards materials control and accountability and allows the user to define the uncertainty parameters of the associated flow and inventory measurements.  The simulated safeguard system uses the uncertain measurement estimates to calculate mass-balance across the {MBA}.  This mass balance is then evaluated by one or more of a number of different statistical tests to determine if a significant amount of material has been removed from the {MBA}.  This thesis describes the development of {SGA}, and presents a number of example scenarios consisting of one or more {MBAs}.  The goal of each of these scenarios is to determine the ability of {SGA} to calculate the Type I (false detect) or Type {II} (missed detection) error probability of the scenario.  In each of these example scenarios, {SGA} generated reasonable results.  To fully demonstrate {SGA}’s capabilities, the thesis also examines a more complicated scenario representative of a closed fuel cycle.  This examination is paired with the operations research {NUclear} Measurement System Optimization ({NUMSO}) toolbox  which calculates the best configuration of measurements based on a user-defined set of objectives.  The two toolboxes allow a user to develop quickly develop a potentially optimal safeguards system with {NUMSO}, and then use {SGA} to examine the detailed behavior of that system.  In every example considered in the thesis, {SGA} performs as designed.},

A power plant dispatching model is built to simulate deregulated markets, in order to identify to what extent additional flexibility is needed from nuclear power due to more renewables. We contribute to the literature with an economic perspective of the nuclear load-following by means of numerical simulations of several European power systems that will pursue the nuclear policy in 2050. Results show that intermittency would make flexible nuclear reactors cycling more often and retire earlier. The highest requirements for flexibility would be in systems with high shares of nuclear, renewables or coal-fired plants (Central-Western Europe and certain Central-Eastern European countries) and in systems with low grid interconnections (Western Europe and South-West). Load-following implies lower capacity factors for nuclear plants, except for Central-Western Europe where operating flexibly would allow reactors to supply more output than in steady-state mode. The lowest generation cost is found in Nordic countries where most of the flexibility is provided by hydro-units, and hence nuclear power plants operate mostly baseload. Ensuring flexibility becomes financially interesting when nuclear power plants are not the marginal technology setting the clearing price; in this way the infra-marginal rent allows operators to capture high revenues. It is shown that nuclear flexibility is profitable from a broader social welfare perspective, such as safe baseload units' operation, renewables' integration, system operators' balancing, and consumer's price.},

	abstract = {Wind and solar power are known to be highly influenced by weather events and may ramp up or down abruptly. Such events in the power production influence not only the availability of energy, but also the stability of the entire power grid. By analysing significant amounts of data from several regions around the world with resolutions of seconds to minutes, we provide strong evidence that renewable wind and solar sources exhibit multiple types of variability and nonlinearity in the time scale of seconds and characterise their stochastic properties. In contrast to previous findings, we show that only the jumpy characteristic of renewable sources decreases when increasing the spatial size over which the renewable energies are harvested. Otherwise, the strong non-Gaussian, intermittent behaviour in the cumulative power of the total field survives even for a country-wide distribution of the systems. The strong fluctuating behaviour of renewable wind and solar sources can be well characterised by Kolmogorov-like power spectra and q-exponential probability density functions. Using the estimated potential shape of power time series, we quantify the jumpy or diffusive dynamic of the power. Finally we propose a time delayed feedback technique as a control algorithm to suppress the observed short term non-Gaussian statistics in spatially strong correlated and intermittent renewable sources.},

	abstract = {The fuel cycle performance and core design of the Transatomic Power liquid-fueled molten salt reactor concept is analyzed. This advanced reactor concept uses configurable zirconium hydride moderator rod assemblies to shift the neutron spectrum in the core from intermediate at beginning of life to thermal at end of life. With a harder spectrum during the early years of reactor operation, this spectral shift design drives captures in fertile 238U. The converted fissile plutonium makes up over 50\% of the fissile material in the fuel salt over the last half (∼15 years) of reactor operation. A softer spectrum late in reactor life helps drive the fuel to a burnup of 90 {GWd}/{MTU}. Continuously changing physics necessitates time-dependent analyses resolved over long timescales (i.e., months to years), as this concept does not meet an equilibrium condition. The spectral shift and molten salt reactor material feeds and removals enable this concept to perform better in fuel cycle metrics, increasing resource utilization by more than 50\% compared with a typical light water reactor (i.e., from ∼0.6\% to ∼1\%). These metrics are compared to similar fuel cycles using alternate technologies. Additional core design and analysis challenges associated with the spectral shift and use of molten salt reactor technology are identified and discussed.},

	abstract = {The {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is our latest recommended evaluated nuclear data file for use in nuclear science and technology applications, and incorporates advances made in the five years since the release of {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0. These advances focus on neutron cross sections, covariances, fission product yields and decay data, and represent work by the {US} Cross Section Evaluation Working Group ({CSEWG}) in nuclear data evaluation that utilizes developments in nuclear theory, modeling, simulation, and experiment. The principal advances in the new library are: (1) An increase in the breadth of neutron reaction cross section coverage, extending from 393 nuclides to 423 nuclides; (2) Covariance uncertainty data for 190 of the most important nuclides, as documented in companion papers in this edition; (3) R-matrix analyses of neutron reactions on light nuclei, including isotopes of He, Li, and Be; (4) Resonance parameter analyses at lower energies and statistical high energy reactions for isotopes of Cl, K, Ti, V, Mn, Cr, Ni, Zr and W; (5) Modifications to thermal neutron reactions on fission products (isotopes of Mo, Tc, Rh, Ag, Cs, Nd, Sm, Eu) and neutron absorber materials (Cd, Gd); (6) Improved minor actinide evaluations for isotopes of U, Np, Pu, and Am (we are not making changes to the major actinides 235,238U and 239Pu at this point, except for delayed neutron data and covariances, and instead we intend to update them after a further period of research in experiment and theory), and our adoption of {JENDL}-4.0 evaluations for isotopes of Cm, Bk, Cf, Es, Fm, and some other minor actinides; (7) Fission energy release evaluations; (8) Fission product yield advances for fission-spectrum neutrons and 14 {MeV} neutrons incident on 239Pu; and (9) A new decay data sublibrary. Integral validation testing of the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 library is provided for a variety of quantities: For nuclear criticality, the {VII}.1 library maintains the generally-good performance seen for {VII}.0 for a wide range of {MCNP} simulations of criticality benchmarks, with improved performance coming from new structural material evaluations, especially for Ti, Mn, Cr, Zr and W. For Be we see some improvements although the fast assembly data appear to be mutually inconsistent. Actinide cross section updates are also assessed through comparisons of fission and capture reaction rate measurements in critical assemblies and fast reactors, and improvements are evident. Maxwellian-averaged capture cross sections at 30 {keV} are also provided for astrophysics applications. We describe the cross section evaluations that have been updated for {ENDF}/B-{VII}.1 and the measured data and calculations that motivated the changes, and therefore this paper augments the {ENDF}/B-{VII}.0 publication [M.

The initial goal was an aircraft propulsion reactor, and a molten fluoride-fueled Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 1954. In 1956, the objective shifted to civilian nuclear power, and reactor concepts were developed using a circulating {UF}4-{ThF}4 fuel, graphite moderator, and Hastelloy N pressure boundary. The program culminated in the successful operation of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment in 1965 to 1969. By then the Atomic Energy Commission’s goals had shifted to breeder development; the molten salt program supported on-site reprocessing development and study of various reactor arrangements that had potential to breed. Some commercial and foreign interest contributed to the program which, however, was terminated by the government in 1976. The current status of the technology and prospects for revived interest are summarized.},

	abstract = {Molten salt reactors have seen a marked resurgence of interest over the past decade, highlighted by their inclusion as one of six Generation {IV} reactor types. The most active development period however was between the mid 1950s and early 1970s at Oak Ridge National Laboratories ({ORNL}) and any new re-examination of this concept must bear in mind the far different priorities then in place. High breeding ratios and short doubling times were paramount and this guided the evolution of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}) program. As the inherent advantages of the molten salt concept have become apparent to an increasing number of researchers worldwide it is important to not simply look to continue where {ORNL} left off but to return to basics in order to offer the best design using updated goals and abilities. A major potential change to the traditional Single Fluid, {MSBR} design and a subject of this presentation is a return to the mode of operation that {ORNL} proposed for the majority of its {MSR} program. That being the Two Fluid design in which separate salts are used for fissile 233UF4 and fertile {ThF}4. Oak Ridge abandoned this promising route due to what was known as the “plumbing problem”. It will be shown that a simple yet crucial modification to core geometry can solve this problem and enable the many advantages of the Two Fluid design. In addition, another very promising route laid out by {ORNL} was simplified Single Fluid converter reactors that could obtain far superior lifetime uranium utilization than {LWR} or {CANDU} without the need for any fuel processing beyond simple chemistry control. Updates and potential improvements to this very attractive concept will also be explored.},

We studied how cooling in the predisposal storage period may aﬀect the design of the emplacement area in a repository for radioactive wastes produced by a light-water-reactor nuclear system that uses {PT} technology. Three diﬀerent fuel cycle scenarios involving {PT} technology were analyzed: 1) partitioning process only (separation of some ﬁssion products), 2) transmutation process only (separation and transmutation of minor actinides), and 3) both partitioning and transmutation. The necessary predisposal storage periods for some predeﬁned emplacement conﬁgurations were determined through transient thermal analysis, and the relation between the storage period and the emplacement area was obtained. For each scenario, we also estimated the storage capacity required for the dry storage of the heat-generating waste forms. The contributions of {PT} technology on the storage and disposal were discussed holistically, and we noted that the coupled introduction of partitioning and transmutation processes can bring an appreciable reduction in waste management size.},

	abstract = {The French 2012–2015 Commission Nationale d’Evaluation Reports emphasize preparation for a transition from Light Water Reactors ({LWRs}) to Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors ({SFRs}). We used the Cyclus nuclear fuel cycle simulator to explore the feasibility of enabling a French transition to an {SFR} fleet by using Used Nuclear Fuel ({UNF}) from other European Union ({EU}) nations. A Cyclus simulation captured nuclear power deployment in the {EU} from 1970 to 2160. In this simulation, France begins its planned transition to {SFRs} as existing {LWRs} are decommissioned. These {SFRs} are fueled with {UNF} accumulated by other {EU} nations and reprocessed in France. The impact of reactor lifetime extensions and {SFR} breeding ratios on time-to-transition were investigated with additional simulations. These simulations demonstrate that France can avoid deployment of additional {LWRs} by accepting {UNF} from other {EU} nations, that lifetime extensions delay time-to-transition, and improved breeding ratios are not particularly impactful.},

This work is intended to cross check the new capabilities of the fuel cycle scenario code {TR}\_EVOL. This process has been divided in two stages. The first stage is dedicated to check the improvements in the nuclear fuel mass balance estimation using the available data for the Spanish nuclear fuel cycle. The second stage has been focused in verifying the validity of the {TR}\_EVOL economic module, comparing results to data published by the {ARCAS} {EU} project. A specific analysis was required to evaluate the back-end cost. Data published by the waste management responsible institutions was used for the validation of the methodology. Results were highly satisfactory for both stages. In particular, the economic assessment provides a difference smaller than 3\% regarding results published by the {ARCAS} project ({NRG} estimations). Furthermore, concerning the back-end cost, results are highly acceptable (7\% difference for a final disposal in a once-through scenario and around 11\% for a final disposal in a reprocessing strategy) given the significant uncertainties involved in design concepts and related unit costs.},

	abstract = {Liquid metal cooled reactors are envisaged to play an important role in the future of nuclear energy production because of their possible efficient use of uranium and the possibility to reduce the volume and lifetime of nuclear waste. Thermal-hydraulics is recognized as a key scientific subject in the development of such reactors. Two important challenges for the design of liquid metal fast reactors ({LMFRs}) are fuel assembly and pool thermal hydraulics. The heart of every nuclear reactor is the core, where the nuclear chain reaction takes place. Heat is produced in the nuclear fuel and transported to the coolant. {LMFR} core designs consist of many fuel assemblies which in turn consist of a large number of fuel rods. Wire wraps are commonly envisaged as spacer design in {LMFR} fuel assemblies. For the design and safety analyses of such reactors, simulations of the heat transport within the core are essential. The flow exiting the core is made up of the outlets of many different fuel assemblies. The liquid metal in these assemblies may be heated up to different temperatures. This leads to temperature fluctuations on various above core structures. As these temperature fluctuations may lead to thermal fatigue damage of the structures, an accurate characterization of the liquid metal flow field in the above core region is very important. This paper will provide an overview of state-of-the-art evaluations of fuel assembly and pool thermal hydraulics for {LMFRs}. It will show the tight interaction required between experiments and advanced numerical simulations. Furthermore, it will highlight the latest worldwide developments using Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) simulation techniques with a special focus on the developments and achievements within {NRG} in the Netherlands. With respect to fuel assembly thermal hydraulics, the latest developments on simulation of fuel assemblies with wire wraps will be highlighted. As well defined experimental data is hard and/or expensive to obtain, detailed {CFD} with advanced turbulence modelling and large computational resources is used to create reliable reference data. Furthermore, simulations applying various turbulence models and different codes are inter-compared to gain confidence in the numerical results. With respect to pool thermal hydraulics, the latest developments using {CFD} with state-of-the-art numerical grid construction and turbulence modelling will be demonstrated. Although experimental data from water and sodium experiments is available in this case for specific designs, a proper validation for the {CFD} simulations is hard to achieve. Again, simulations by using different numerical codes, grids, and turbulence models are inter-compared to gain confidence in the numerical results.},

We have analysed these benchmark problems using the {VISWAM} code system. The lattice analysis method initially implemented in {VISWAM} code was based on a combination of 1D multigroup transport and a 2D few group diffusion theory. We have recently developed the interface current method based on 2D collision probability ({CP}) and incorporated the same in {VISWAM} code. The present {VISWAM} code considers the angular flux expansion up to P2 Legendre polynomials in hexagonal geometry which is new and not reported in literature to the best knowledge of authors. The present paper studies the benchmark problem using the two models present in {VISWAM} and studies the effect of different flux anisotropies on the benchmark results. The results obtained with {VISWAM} are compared with the other benchmark evaluations given in benchmark specification report.},

	abstract = {In performance assessment studies of radioactive waste disposal in crystalline rocks, one source of uncertainty is the appropriateness of conceptual models of the physical processes contributing to the potential transport of radionuclides. The Alternative Models Project ({AMP}) evaluates the uncertainty of models of groundwater flow, an uncertainty that arises from alternative conceptualisations of groundwater movement in fractured media. The {AMP} considers three modelling approaches for simulating flow and advective transport from the waste canisters to the biosphere: Stochastic Continuum, Discrete Fracture Network, and Channel Network. Each approach addresses spatial variability via Monte Carlo simulation, whose realisations are summarised by the statistics of three simplified measures of geosphere performance: travel time, transport resistance (a function of travel distance, flow-wetted surface per volume of rock, and Darcy velocity along a flowpath), and canister flux (Darcy velocity at repository depth). The {AMP} uses a common reference case defined by a specific model domain, boundary conditions, and layout of a hypothetical repository, with a consistent set of summary statistics to facilitate the comparison of the three approaches. The three modelling approaches predict similar median travel times and median canister fluxes, but dissimilar variability. The three modelling approaches also predict similar values for minimum travel time and maximum canister flux, and predict similar locations for particles exiting the geosphere. The results suggest that the problem specifications (i.e. boundary conditions and gross hydrogeology) constrain the flow modelling, limiting the impact of this conceptual uncertainty on performance assessment.},

To provide a review for researchers as well as field practitioners who may need to select and use models of varying degrees of complexity, summaries of 56 major numerical codes are made in comparative tables with selected references for three broad classes of codes: hydrologic transport models, geochemical models, and hydrochemical models that combine the chemical and transport models. Criteria for code selection and explanations as to how their characteristics were compiled are described. The governing equations for hydrologic flow, solute transport, and chemical relations are briefly described and discussed in light of the assumptions made by the different codes that employ them. Limitations of current modeling conceptualization and practice and areas of present active research effort are noted. Some comments are also given on model validation, a topic of current concern for modeling.

	abstract = {A rigorous econometric calibration of a model of energy consumption is presented using a comprehensive time series database on energy consumption and other socioeconomic indicators. The future of nuclear power in the evolving distribution of various energy sources is also examined. An important consideration for the long-term future of nuclear power concerns the rate of decline of the fraction of energy that comes from coal, which has historically declined on a global basis about linearly as a function of the cumulative use of coal. The use of fluid fossil fuels is also expected to eventually decline as the more readily extractable deposits are depleted. The investigation here is restricted to examining a comparatively simple model of the dynamics of competition between nuclear and other competing energy sources.
Using a defined tropical/temperate disaggregation of the world, region-specific modeling results are presented for population growth, {GDP} growth, energy use, and carbon use compatible with a gradual transition to energy sustainability. Results for the fractions of energy use from various sources by grouping nine commercial primary energy sources into pairs of competing fuel categories are presented in combination with the idea of experiential learning and resource depletion. Analysis based on this division provides estimates for future evolution of the fractional shares, annual use rates, cumulative use of individual energy sources, and the economic attractiveness of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing. This unified approach helps to conceptualize and understand the dynamics of evolution of importance of various energy resources over time.},

	abstract = {{KAERI} developed a reference repository system for the disposal of radioactive wastes resulting from the pyroprocessing of {PWR} spent nuclear fuels (A-{KRS}; Advanced Korean Reference Disposal System). To check the design feasibility of this system, we developed a total system performance assessment ({TSPA}) tool using Goldsim program ({GoldSim}, 2006) and assessed the exposure dose rates for the reference scenario and three alternative scenarios such as earthquake, well intrusion, and initial defect of waste packages by using this tool. And then, we compared the exposure dose rates for each scenario with a draft supplementary safety goal, 10 {mSv}/yr, which was suggested by the regulatory body in Korea. In the original {TSPA} tool, we use a single source term model by assigning the same reference radionuclide inventory data for each waste package and the same shortest distance from the waste package to the {MWCF} (Major Waster Conducting Features) for conservatism. We developed a multi-lattice source term model by assigning various radionuclide inventory data and various distance from the waste package to the {MWCF} for more realistic safety assessment. Then, we found that the exposure dose rates for the case of multi-lattice source term model was one order of magnitude lower than those for the case of single source term model. According to the draft safety guideline, the primary safety goal is expressed in risk, that is, the total annual risk for the representative person resulting from the radiation exposure should not exceed 1.0 × 10−6/yr. Therefore, we developed a methodology for complex scenarios to perform the risk-based safety assessment of a {HLW} repository, and applied it to a reference repository system. And we found that the suggested methodology can be used to perform the risk-based long-term safety assessment of a radioactive waste repository. We can make various risk profiles by making various kinds of complex scenarios with this methodology, and they can be used to support the development of safety cases for acquiring public acceptance.},

All the zirconium hydrides prepared in the present study showed {CaF}2 type δ {ZrH}2−x. The lattice parameter slightly increased with the hydrogen content. The thermal expansion coefficients of the zirconium hydrides evaluated from high-temperature X-ray diffraction data were larger than that of zirconium metal and increased with the hydrogen content. The longitudinal and shear sound velocities of the zirconium hydride were slightly different from those of zirconium metal, which enabled us to estimate the elastic properties. The zirconium hydride had higher elastic moduli than zirconium metal and the elastic moduli slightly depended on the hydrogen content. The microhardness of the zirconium hydride was much higher than that of zirconium metal and decreased with increasing hydrogen content. The Debye temperature of the zirconium hydride estimated from the sound velocities was larger than that of pure zirconium metal. The heat capacity was also estimated from the sound velocities and the thermal expansion data.},

	abstract = {This paper focuses on the freeze-plug, a key safety component of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor, one of the Gen. {IV} nuclear reactors that must excel in safety, reliability, and sustainability. The freeze-plug is a valve made of frozen fuel salt, designed to melt when an event requiring the core drainage occurs. Melting and draining must be passive, relying on decay heat and gravity, and must occur before the reactor incurs structural damage. In this work, we preliminarily investigate the freeze-plug melting behavior, assessing the influence of various design configurations and parameters (e.g., sub-cooling, recess depth). We used {COMSOL} Multiphysics® to simulate melting, adopting an apparent heat capacity method. Results show that single-plug designs generally outperform multi-plug ones, where melting is inhibited by the formation of a frozen layer on top of the metal grate hosting the plugs. The layer thickness strongly depends on sub-cooling and recess depth. For multi-plug designs, the P/D ratio has a negligible influence on melting and can therefore be chosen to optimize the draining time. The absence of significant mixing in the pipe region above the plug leads to acceptable melting times (i.e., {\textless}1000 s) only for distances from the core up to 0.1 m, considered insufficient to host all the cooling equipment on the outside of the draining pipe and to protect the plug from possible large temperature oscillations in the core. Consequently, we conclude that the current freeze-plug design based only on decay heat to melt is likely to be unfeasible. A design improvement, preserving passivity and studied within the {SAMOFAR} project (http://samofar.eu/), consists in accelerating melting via heat stored in steel masses adjacent to the draining pipe.},

	abstract = {Thermal fluid processes are inherently multi-physics and multi-scale, involving mass-momentum-energy transport phenomena at multiple scales. Thermal fluid simulation ({TFS}) is based on solving conservative equations, for which – except for “first-principles” direct numerical simulation – closure relations ({CRs}) are required to provide microscopic interactions or so-called sub-grid-scale physics. In practice, {TFS} is realized through reduced-order modeling, and its {CRs} as low-fidelity models can be informed by observations and data from relevant and adequately evaluated experiments and high-fidelity simulations. This paper is focused on data-driven {TFS} models, specifically on their development using machine learning ({ML}). Five {ML} frameworks are introduced including physics-separated {ML} ({PSML} or Type I {ML}), physics-evaluated {ML} ({PEML} or Type {II} {ML}), physics-integrated {ML} ({PIML} or Type {III} {ML}), physics-recovered ({PRML} or Type {IV} {ML}), and physics-discovered {ML} ({PDML} or Type V {ML}). The frameworks vary in their performance for different applications depending on the level of knowledge of governing physics, source, type, amount and quality of available data for training. Notably, outlined for the first time in this paper, Type {III} models present stringent requirements on modeling, substantial computing resources for training, and high potential in extracting value from “big data” in thermal fluid research. The current paper demonstrates and investigates {ML} frameworks in three examples. First, we utilize the heat diffusion equation with a nonlinear conductivity model formulated by convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and feedforward neural networks ({FNNs}) to illustrate the applications of Type I, Type {II}, Type {III}, and Type V {ML}. The results indicate a preference for Type {II} {ML} under deficient data support. Type {III} {ML} can effectively utilize field data, potentially generating more robust predictions than Type I and Type {II} {ML}. {CNN}-based closures exhibit more predictability than {FNN}-based closures, but {CNN}-based closures require more training data to obtain accurate predictions. Second, we illustrate how to employ Type I {ML} and Type {II} {ML} frameworks for data-driven turbulence modeling using reference works. Third, we demonstrate Type I {ML} by building a deep {FNN}-based slip closure for two-phase flow modeling. The results show that deep {FNN}-based closures exhibit a bounded error in the prediction domain.},

Comparisons are made using partition balance metrics for different decomposition schemes in 2D and 3D simulations.

	abstract = {Path to zero carbon emissions
Models show that to avert dangerous levels of climate change, global carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero later this century. Most of these emissions arise from energy use. Davis et al. review what it would take to achieve decarbonization of the energy system. Some parts of the energy system are particularly difficult to decarbonize, including aviation, long-distance transport, steel and cement production, and provision of a reliable electricity supply. Current technologies and pathways show promise, but integration of now-discrete energy sectors and industrial processes is vital to achieve minimal emissions.
Science, this issue p. eaas9793
Structured Abstract
{BACKGROUNDNet} emissions of {CO}2 by human activities—including not only energy services and industrial production but also land use and agriculture—must approach zero in order to stabilize global mean temperature. Energy services such as light-duty transportation, heating, cooling, and lighting may be relatively straightforward to decarbonize by electrifying and generating electricity from variable renewable energy sources (such as wind and solar) and dispatchable (“on-demand”) nonrenewable sources (including nuclear energy and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage). However, other energy services essential to modern civilization entail emissions that are likely to be more difficult to fully eliminate. These difficult-to-decarbonize energy services include aviation, long-distance transport, and shipping; production of carbon-intensive structural materials such as steel and cement; and provision of a reliable electricity supply that meets varying demand. Moreover, demand for such services and products is projected to increase substantially over this century. The long-lived infrastructure built today, for better or worse, will shape the future.Here, we review the special challenges associated with an energy system that does not add any {CO}2 to the atmosphere (a net-zero emissions energy system). We discuss prominent technological opportunities and barriers for eliminating and/or managing emissions related to the difficult-to-decarbonize services; pitfalls in which near-term actions may make it more difficult or costly to achieve the net-zero emissions goal; and critical areas for research, development, demonstration, and deployment. It may take decades to research, develop, and deploy these new technologies.
{ADVANCESA} successful transition to a future net-zero emissions energy system is likely to depend on vast amounts of inexpensive, emissions-free electricity; mechanisms to quickly and cheaply balance large and uncertain time-varying differences between demand and electricity generation; electrified substitutes for most fuel-using devices; alternative materials and manufacturing processes for structural materials; and carbon-neutral fuels for the parts of the economy that are not easily electrified. Recycling and removal of carbon from the atmosphere (carbon management) is also likely to be an important activity of any net-zero emissions energy system. The specific technologies that will be favored in future marketplaces are largely uncertain, but only a finite number of technology choices exist today for each functional role. To take appropriate actions in the near term, it is imperative to clearly identify desired end points. To achieve a robust, reliable, and affordable net-zero emissions energy system later this century, efforts to research, develop, demonstrate, and deploy those candidate technologies must start now.
{OUTLOOKCombinations} of known technologies could eliminate emissions related to all essential energy services and processes, but substantial increases in costs are an immediate barrier to avoiding emissions in each category. In some cases, innovation and deployment can be expected to reduce costs and create new options. More rapid changes may depend on coordinating operations across energy and industry sectors, which could help boost utilization rates of capital-intensive assets, but this will require overcoming institutional and organizational challenges in order to create new markets and ensure cooperation among regulators and disparate, risk-averse businesses. Two parallel and broad streams of research and development could prove useful: research in technologies and approaches that can decarbonize provision of the most difficult-to-decarbonize energy services, and research in systems integration that would allow reliable and cost-effective provision of these services. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/360/6396/eaas9793/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint A shower of molten metal in a steel foundry.Industrial processes such as steelmaking will be particularly challenging to decarbonize. Meeting future demand for such difficult-to-decarbonize energy services and industrial products without adding {CO}2 to the atmosphere may depend on technological cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.
Some energy services and industrial processes—such as long-distance freight transport, air travel, highly reliable electricity, and steel and cement manufacturing—are particularly difficult to provide without adding carbon dioxide ({CO}2) to the atmosphere. Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent. We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of {CO}2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries.},

The design of a core that optimizes these multiple objectives often presents a multidimensional (i.e., in design space), multiobjective optimization problem. The developed systematic approach discussed herein draws on response surface methodology to validate and leverage a surrogate model to serve in place of high-fidelity computational analyses. Optimization and design analysis methods leverage this surrogate model to provide a flexible tool for generating optimized designs and understanding the impact of design decisions on desired metrics. In applications to High Flux Isotope Reactor ({HFIR}) low-enriched uranium ({LEU}) core designs, neutronic, isotopic evolution, and thermal hydraulic analyses are used to generate key performance and safety metrics for assessing the feasibility and fitness of given designs. Three optimized designs that consider different desired metrics and constraints (e.g., key metric weighting and fabrication constraints) are presented, providing potential design options that satisfy the requirements for {HFIR}’s conversion from high enriched uranium to {LEU} fuel.},

	title = {3D Coupled Transient simulation of a Fast Liquid Fuel Molten Salt Reactor Primary Loop Using {GeN}-Foam},
	abstract = {In the recent years, Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}) has become an important tool in modeling of nuclear reactors. In this study, a three-dimensional (3D) fast spectrum Liquid Fuel Molten Salt Reactor ({LFMSR}) primary loop is modelled to simulate transient scenarios that are relevant from the safety point of view using the new multi-physics solver Generalized Nuclear Foam ({GeN}-Foam). {GeN}-Foam is built based on the C++ open-source library for the solution of continuum mechanics problems {OpenFOAM}. The code utilizes a unified fine/coarse mesh approach based on porous medium equations modeling the different physics such as neutron kinetic, thermal hydraulics and structural thermal mechanics. The standard k-ε turbulence model has been used for this study, and a chloride-based fuel salt has been selected for its good thermophysical properties and for its low moderating power that make it a perfect candidate for the fast spectrum {LFMSR} reactors. The proposed {LFMSR} is based on eight symmetrical loops therefore just one eighth of the reactor has been simulated. The {GeN}-Foam coarse mesh approach, based on the porous media equations, is used for modeling all the different components of the primary loop including the reactor active core, heat exchanger, and the pump. An Unprotected Loss of Flow accident ({ULOF}) in which the pump head has been instantaneously reduced to zero has been selected to test the reactor in one of the most challenging possible situations. The obtained results confirm {GeN}-Foam capabilities in performing coupled {LFMSR} transient analysis and its validity as a tool for the design analysis and optimization. Although the current design needs further assessment and development, it showed encouraging performance during the {ULOF} simulation paving the way to the next step in the optimization process.},

	abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we explore ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible by suitably factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization. We benchmark our methods on the {ILSVRC} 2012 classification challenge validation set demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art: 21.2\% top-1 and 5.6\% top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters. With an ensemble of 4 models and multi-crop evaluation, we report 3.5\% top-5 error on the validation set (3.6\% error on the test set) and 17.3\% top-1 error on the validation set.},

Molten salts may be used for fuel processing and spent fuel recycling, for heat transfer, as a homogeneous fuel and as a breeder material in fusion systems. Fluorides that are stable at high temperature and under high neutron flux are especially promising. Analysis of several field cases reveals that corrosion in molten fluorides is essentially due to the oxidation of metals by uranium fluoride and/or oxidizing impurities. The thermodynamics of this process are discussed with an emphasis on understanding the mass transfer in the systems, selecting appropriate metallic materials and designing effective purification methods.},

These neural networks were trained by supervised learning from human expert moves, and by reinforcement learning from self-play. Here we introduce an algorithm based solely on reinforcement learning, without human data, guidance or domain knowledge beyond game rules. {AlphaGo} becomes its own teacher: a neural network is trained to predict {AlphaGo}’s own move selections and also the winner of {AlphaGo}’s games. This neural network improves the strength of the tree search, resulting in higher quality move selection and stronger self-play in the next iteration.

	abstract = {In many fuel cycle simulators, the user must define a deployment scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid supply chain gaps. To ease setting up nuclear fuel cycle simulations, Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) simulators should bring demand-responsive deployment decisions into the dynamics of the simulation logic. Thus, a next-generation {NFC} simulator should predictively and automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet a user-defined power demand. {CYCLUS} is an agent-based nuclear fuel cycle simulation framework [4]. In {CYCLUS}, each entity (i.e. Region, Institution, or Facility) in the fuel cycle is an agent. Region agents represent geographical or political areas that institution and facility agents can be grouped into. Institution agents control the deployment and decommission of facility agents and represents legal operating organizations such as a utility, government, etc. Facility agents represent nuclear fuel cycle facilities. {CYCAMORE} provides agents to represent process physics of various components in the nuclear fuel cycle (e.g. mine, fuel enrichment facility, reactor). The Demand-Driven {CYCAMORE} Archetypes project ({NEUP}-{FY}16-10512) aims to develop {CYCLUS}’ demand-driven deployment capabilities. This capability is added as a {CYCLUS} Institution agent that deploys facilities to meet the front-end and back-end fuel cycle demands based on a user-defined commodity demand. This demand-driven deployment capability is called d3ploy. In this paper, we explain the capabilities of d3ploy and demonstrate how d3ploy minimizes undersupply of all commodities in a few simulations while meeting key simulation constraints. Constant, linearly increasing, and sinusoidal power demand transition scenarios are demonstrated. Insights are discussed to inform parameter input decisions for future work in setting up larger transition scenarios that include many facilities. And finally, the more complex transition scenarios are demonstrated.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account1, deeply rooted in psychological2 and neuroscientific3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems4,5, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms3. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains6,7,8, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks9,10,11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games12. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

Recent results have also shown that this technique has the potential to benefit over other approaches due to the fact that the signal can simultaneously be analyzed over multiple scales by using wavelet analysis, thus eliminating potential false isotope identifications from artifacts such as the Compton edge and backscatter peaks. This implies that this peak localization algorithm is no longer a function of detector resolution, which changes with energy. We will present our results evaluating the technique of wavelet analysis for low-resolution ({NaI}) gamma-ray spectra. Emphasis will be placed on wavelet selection and the incorporation of a simple algorithm to the problem of isotope identification},

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep \$Q\$-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},

@report{oklo_inc._pilot_2018,
	title = {Pilot Application for {DG}-1353, Enclosure 1},
	abstract = {This application structure is being submitted as a pilot for draft regulatory guide ({DG})-1353, “Guidance For A Technology-Inclusive, Risk-Informed, and Performance-Based Approach to Inform the Content of Applications for Licenses, Certifications, and Approvals for Non-Light- Water Reactors.” In public meetings, {NRC} staff issued a call for designers to pilot the upcoming draft guidance. Oklo is offering this pilot of the guidance as an example for {NRC} staff in evaluation of the possible benefits, drawbacks, or other impacts of a proposed guidance. The goal is not to show the impacts of the guidance in a final form, but for illustrative purposes in a possible application structure how the guidance may be used for a particular design, and further how the implications of its use might affect a submittal to the {NRC} on a relatively holistic basis. Although the Draft Guidance intends to reference a future {NEI} report, for the purposes of the preparation of this report, the Licensing Modernization Project report “Risk- Informed Performance-Based Guidance for Non-Light Water Reactor Licensing Basis Development,” Revision L, issued May 25, 2018 was used.
The {DG}-1353 provides an alternative means for performing the necessary tasks of analyzing licensing basis events and for assessing safety-relation of structures, systems, and components ({SSCs}) as well as defense-in-depth. The guidance is part of a broader transformation of the {NRC} to more effectively regulate potential new technologies, which is described in {SECY}-18- 0060, “Achieving Modern Risk-Informed Regulation,” and other documents.
Of particular concern to {NRC} staff is ensuring that the level of detail submitted and reviewed in regulatory review is appropriate to that required to make decisions, especially safety decisions on the design in question. Excessive detail would slow review, and utilize unnecessary federal resources, while too little detail would have the same effect, due to the need for the {NRC} to ask questions on detail not provided but needed to reach a decision.
It is expected that the proposed guidance could provide a framework for both applicants and the {NRC} to have more regulatory certainty on level of detail required for applications. The {DG}- 1353 framework provides a baseline for what {SSCs} are safety-related or important to safety, and therefore a relative basis for application content as far as level of information necessary and appropriate for topics required by regulation to be addressed in an application. This pilot submittal in particular may provide one perspective on how analysis of licensing basis events, safety-relation and importance to safety of structures, systems, and components, and resulting evidence of defense-in-depth may affect level of detail to meet existing regulatory requirements in a possible application. The structure of this pilot submittal was developed directly from regulatory requirements for application structure. These requirements are outlined in Title 10 to the Code of Federal Regulations (10 {CFR}) sections as appropriate for different approval, certification, permits, or licensing pathways. For example, for a standard design certification, rules for contents of applications are specified in 10 {CFR} 52.46 and 52.47. For a standard design approval, rules for contents of applications is given in 10 {CFR} 52.136 and 10 {CFR} 52.137. For a combined license ({COL}) application, rules for contents of applications are given in 10 {CFR} 52.77, 52.79, and 52.80. In the interest of holistic application of the concepts covered in the {DG}- 1353, the requirements for a {COL} application were followed.},

	url = {https://doi.org/10.13182/NT16-28},

	abstract = {The fluoride salt–cooled high-temperature reactor ({FHR}) with a nuclear air-Brayton combined cycle ({NACC}) and firebrick resistance-heated energy storage ({FIRES}) is a new reactor and plant concept. The development of a new reactor is a large undertaking that requires a strong commercial case and a strong basis for government support to enable commercialization. The goals are (1) increase plant revenue by 50\% to 100\% relative to base-load nuclear plants with capital costs similar to light water reactors, (2) enable a zero-carbon nuclear renewable electricity grid, (3) no potential for major fuel failure and thus no potential for major radionuclide off-site releases in a beyond-design-basis accident, and (4) offer a pathway to more advanced energy systems. The approaches to achieve those goals are described herein.The {FHR} uses liquid-salt coolants originally developed for molten salt reactors ({MSRs}) where the fuel is dissolved in the coolant. However, in the {FHR} the fuel is not dissolved in the coolant. Instead, the {FHR} uses graphite-based high-temperature gas-cooled reactor ({HTGR}) coated-particle fuel. This combination enables delivering heat to the power cycle between 600°C and 700°C that, in turn, enables the {FHR} to couple to {NACC}. Using an air-Brayton power cycle enables the {FHR} to operate as a base-load reactor and produce added electricity in a peaking mode with the addition of auxiliary heat (natural gas, stored heat, or hydrogen). The auxiliary heat-to-electricity production is a thermodynamic topping cycle with efficiencies of 66\%. Because an {FHR} with {NACC} is more efficient in converting natural gas into peak electricity than a stand-alone natural gas plant (60\%), it can economically compete with a natural gas plant for peak electricity production because it uses less fuel. {NACC} can also incorporate {FIRES} heat storage that enables buying electricity at low prices to later sell electricity at high prices. For every 100 {MW}(electric) of base-load capacity, the station output can vary from minus several hundred megawatts to +242 {MW}(electric) because of the capabilities of the {NACC} with {FIRES}. The {FHR} can be built in different sizes.The use of high-temperature liquid-salt cooling and coated-particle fuel enables near-term reactor designs where large-scale fuel failure cannot occur, and thus, large-scale off-site releases of radionuclides cannot occur. Under extreme accident conditions decay heat can be passively conducted to the environment at temperatures below fuel failure temperatures and thus avoid the potential for large-scale radionuclide releases.The {FHR} is the gateway technology to several advanced salt-cooled reactor systems that have additional capabilities. The {MSR} can be designed to enable breeding and actinide waste burning. New high-magnetic-field fusion systems may require liquid-salt cooling. The {FHR} would provide the required salt and power cycle technology for these advanced reactors. There are significant development challenges. The United States has a competitive advantage in developing the {FHR} because it leads in gas turbine technology, high-temperature materials, and {HTGR} fuels.},

	abstract = {Liquid-fueled nuclear reactors, particularly molten salt reactors ({MSRs}), have recently gained significant interest in the advanced reactor community. As with all reactors, modeling and simulation are critical to advanced reactor design and licensing and will be required for {MSR} deployment. However, there are significant gaps in existing simulation capabilities for {MSRs}, particularly with the unique challenges of liquid-fueled systems (e.g., fission product transport). Furthermore, advanced reactor designers require near-term tools that are readily modifiable to perform design and analysis, including the ability to extend their analysis beyond the primary system to auxiliary systems. Transient Simulation Framework of Reconfigurable Models ({TRANSFORM}), a Modelica-based, system modeling library developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, is an advanced tool that can help meet some of the near-term needs of the advanced reactor community. This paper describes advanced system modeling criteria and presents {TRANSFORM} to the advanced reactor community by demonstration of system modeling capabilities and support of advanced analysis workflows, i.e., the Risk Analysis Virtual Environment ({RAVEN}) framework from Idaho National Laboratory, using the liquid-fueled Molten Salt Demonstration Reactor ({MSDR}) as a reference design.},

The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission ({NRC}) has established regulations and guidance to implement a policy of siting nuclear reactors away from very densely populated centers. The {NRC}’s guidance and experience for siting nuclear power plants mostly relate to large light-water
reactors ({LWRs}). The siting of large {LWRs} is based on an assumed severe accident with
substantial melting of the core and the subsequent large release of radioactive material from the plant.

Compared to previous generations of reactor designs, advanced reactor designs are expected to have a reduced likelihood of accidents and to involve a smaller and slower release of radioactive material in the unlikely event of an accident. Through its interactions with stakeholders, the {NRC} staff has identified the issue of population-related siting considerations
for advanced reactors as a matter that warrants possible actions by the {NRC}.},

	abstract = {The University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign ({UIUC}) is engaged in work to develop a fuel processing system that enables load-following in Molten Salt Reactors ({MSRs}), an important ability that allows nuclear power plants to ramp electricity production up or down to meet changing electricity demand. Nuclear reactions in {MSRs} produce unwanted byproducts (such as xenon and krypton) that can adversely affect power production. In steady, baseload operation, these byproducts form and decay at the same rate. When electricity production is ramped down, however, the byproducts start to be produced at a greater rate than they decay, leading to a buildup within the reactor. When power production must be once again increased, the response rate is slowed by the time needed for the byproducts to reach their equilibrium level (determined by the radioactive decay half-life, which is on the order of hours). Thus, buildup of these unwanted byproducts resulting from ramping down inhibit proper load following for molten salt reactors. Fortunately, {MSRs} transport fuel in a flowing molten salt fuel loop, which means that a section of the reactor, outside the core, can be leveraged for fuel processing and "cleanup." The team will determine the feasibility of removal of these unwanted byproducts and de- sign a fuel reprocessing system, removing a major barrier to commercialization for molten salt reactors.

Toward this work, we initiated the Fuel Cycle Simulation task (Task 2) in August 2018 to more realistically model the online reprocessing system of the Transatomic Power ({TAP}) {MSR}. A Python toolkit, {SaltProc} v0.1 [1–3], was developed to represent the simplified online fuel salt processing of a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor ({MSBR}). More recently, an advanced {SaltProc} version ({SaltProc} v0.2) was developed to generically simulate complex molten salt fuel reprocessing systems, including the {TAP} system, incorporating user-parametrized components into the fuel salt processing design. This report summarizes the progress we have made towards milestone M2.1: Demonstrate {SaltProc} and the steps toward the subsequent Task 2 objectives.},

Deep learning gained additional interest in today's applications due to its capability to handle complex and high dimensional problems. In this study, multi-layer {GMDH} networks are used to perform uncertainty quantification ({UQ}) and sensitivity analysis ({SA}) of nuclear reactor simulations. {GMDH} is utilized as a surrogate/metamodel to replace high fidelity computer models with cheap-to-evaluate surrogate models, which facilitate {UQ} and {SA} tasks (e.g. variance decomposition, uncertainty propagation, etc.). {GMDH} performance is validated through two {UQ} applications in reactor simulations: (1) low dimensional input space (two-phase flow in a reactor channel), and (2) high dimensional space (8-group homogenized cross-sections). In both applications, {GMDH} networks show very good performance with small mean absolute and squared errors as well as high accuracy in capturing the target variance. {GMDH} is utilized afterward to perform {UQ} tasks such as variance decomposition through Sobol indices, and {GMDH}-based uncertainty propagation with large number of samples. {GMDH} performance is also compared to other surrogates including Gaussian processes and polynomial chaos expansions. The comparison shows that {GMDH} has competitive performance with the other methods for the low dimensional problem, and reliable performance for the high dimensional problem.},

With the adoption of heat pipe, monolithic core and high efficient energy conversion system, this reactor is greatly simplified by omitting the main pipeline, circulating pump and auxiliary equipments, which results in a low cost and compact system. The monolithic reactor design is highly evolved in neutronics and thermal hydraulics. Compared with the commercial nuclear power plant, these micro reactors are factory manufacturable and transportable, thus the launch or transportation accident safety should be guaranteed. Until now, this kind of reactor design of kilowatt level is more mature than that of megawatt level.

	abstract = {Nuclear power plants are known as low carbon baseload electricity generating options, but can they become sufficiently flexible to follow the fluctuating demand economically? Small modular reactors, conceived to address the issues associated with large sized nuclear reactors such as safety, costs, and completion timeline, can offer some flexibility through modularity. However, there remain the questions of whether and how these advanced concepts could become commercially viable for load-following electricity production. From the perspective of integrated long-term energy planning and in a scenario-based approach, this study is conceived to evaluate the economic feasibility of flexible energy productions from two first-of-a-kind demonstration projects; namely a floating nuclear power plant {KLT}-40S in Russia and a high temperature reactor pebble-bed module or {HTR}-{PM} in China. Although both projects are solely designed for electric-application, this study proposes the evaluation of a load-following arrangement through the co-production of hydrogen and the integration of grid-connected battery energy storage systems. All scenarios are investigated using a conservative or a reasonable worst-case approach so as to contribute to setting the bottom line for future commercial deployment of small modular reactors. Findings suggest that small modular reactors can already be commercially deployed in the short-to mid-term, and there are opportunities for further cost reductions through technological innovation and economies of repeat project implementation.},

In this paper we present the fuel cycle and neutronics analysis of a design expected to be similar to the Westinghouse {eVinci}™ heat pipe ({HP}) reactor. The concept considered here uses low enriched urania rods and potassium liquid metal-cooled {HPs} to remove heat from the core. The fuel and {HPs} are contained in steel monolith to form the core which is surrounded by an alumina reflector. There is no need for forced circulation to remove heat from the active core region, thus eliminating the use of pumps, valves and tube piping. The concept is designed to operate safely and provide a reliable autonomous power supply in support of off-grid missions. This study shows that the {HP} reactor design can operate for more than 10 years without refueling. Further, we show that the current design of the {HP} reactor concept is best suited to serve as a nuclear battery rather than a centralized power source. We also studied the nuclear fuel cycle performance of the {HP} reactor concept in a once-through fuel cycle. The natural resource utilization, waste output, and environmental impact, as defined in a reference study from the literature, did not perform as well on a {GWe} per year energy basis compared to light water reactors with less than 5\% enriched uranium in a once-through fuel cycle. Parasitic absorption in the steel monolith structure and neutron leakage lower the reactivity of the core, which decreases the discharge burnup of the fuel. Analysis of modifications of the monolith material and size of the reference core configuration showed that the neutron leakage impact on the small sized {HP} core is the most limiting factor on the fuel cycle performance.},

	abstract = {Hydrogen as an energy carrier allows the decarbonization of transport, industry, and space heating as well as storage for intermittent renewable energy. The objective of this paper is to assess the future engineering potential for hydrogen and provide insight to areas of research to help lower economic barriers for hydrogen adoption. This assessment was accomplished by creating top-level system models based on energy requirements for end-use services. Those models were used to investigate four case studies that provide a global view augmented with specific national examples. The first case study assesses the potential penetration of hydrogen using a global energy system model. The second applies the dynamic integrated climate–ecosystem–economics model to derive an estimate of the impact of the diffusion of hydrogen as an energy carrier. The third determines the required growth in renewable power and water usage to power transportation in the United States ({US}) with hydrogen. The fourth assesses the use of hydrogen for heating in the United Kingdom ({UK}). In all cases, there appeared to be significant potential for hydrogen adoption and net energetic benefit. Globally, hydrogen has the potential to account for approximately 3\% of energy consumption by 2050. In the {US}, using hydrogen for on-road transportation could enable a reduction in rejected energy of nearly 10\%. Also, hydrogen might provide the least cost alternative to decarbonizing space heating in the {UK}. The research highlights a challenge raised by widespread abandonment of nuclear power. It is currently unclear what the removal of nuclear would do to the cost of energy as nations attempt to limit global greenhouse gas emissions. Nuclear power has also been proposed as a source for large scale production of hydrogen. Finally, this analysis shows that with today's technological maturity making the transition to a hydrogen economy would incur significant costs.},

	abstract = {As the U.S. energy system evolves, the amount of electricity from variable-generation sources is likely to increase, which could result in additional times when electricity demand is lower than available production. Thus, purveyors of technologies that traditionally have provided base-load electricity—such as nuclear power plants—can explore new operating procedures to deal with the associated market signals. Concurrently, innovations in nuclear reactor design coupled with sophisticated control systems now allow for more complex apportionment of heat within an integrated system such as one linked to energy-intensive chemical processes. This paper explores one opportunity – nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems. These are defined as integrated facilities comprised of nuclear reactors, renewable energy generation, and industrial processes that can simultaneously address the need for grid flexibility, greenhouse gas emission reductions, and optimal use of investment capital. Six aspects of interaction (interconnections) between elements of nuclear-renewable hybrid energy systems are identified: Thermal, electrical, chemical, hydrogen, mechanical, and information. Additionally, system-level aspects affect selection, design, and operation of this hybrid system type. Throughout the paper, gaps and research needs are identified to promote further exploration of the topic.},

Two types of {MSR} concepts were studied and developed in parallel, namely the {MSR} with liquid fuel and that with solid fuel. Abundant fundamental research including the neutronics modeling, thermal-hydraulics modeling, safety analysis, material investigation, molten salts technologies etc. were carried out. Some analysis software such as {COUPLE} and {FANCY} were developed. Several experimental facilities like high-temperature fluoride salt experiment loop have been constructed. Some passive residual heat removal systems were designed, and 1 test facility is under construction. The key {MSR} techniques including the extraction and separation of molten salt and construction of N-base alloy have been mastered. Based on these fundamental research, Chinese Academy of Sciences has completed the design of thorium-based {MSRs} with solid fuel and liquid fuel and is promoting their construction in the near future. In China, future efforts should be paid to the material, online fuel processing, Th-U fuel cycle, component design, and construction and thermal-hydraulic experiments for {MSR}, which are rather challenging nowadays.},

	abstract = {Nuclear power can play an important role in our energy future, helping to meet increasing electricity demand while at the same time decreasing carbon dioxide emissions. However, the nuclear fuel cycle in the United States today is unsustainable. The 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act establishes the U.S. Department of Energy as responsible for disposing of spent nuclear fuel ({SNF}) generated by commercial nuclear power plants operating in a “once-through” fuel cycle in a deep geologic repository located at Yucca Mountain, {NV}. However, unyielding political opposition to the Yucca Mountain site has hindered the commissioning process to the extent that the current administration has recently declared the site unsuitable. In light of this, the {DOE} is exploring other options, including closing the fuel cycle through reprocessing and recycling of spent nuclear fuel. The possibility of closing the fuel cycle is receiving special attention because of its ability to minimize the final high level waste package by separating and isolating the most long-lived components, as well as recovering additional energy value from the original fuel. Reprocessing and recycling of {SNF} can decrease the volume of waste stored by a factor of 4 and reduce the timeframe of storage from hundreds of thousands of years to thousands of years. Reprocessing and recycling technologies are, however, still very controversial because of the increased cost and proliferation risk reprocessing can present. Estimates of increases in the levelized cost of electricity with reprocessing range from about 10\% to 50\% due to large uncertainties in the financing, construction, and licensing of a new plant. Ultimately, the U.S. will need to compare each of these fuel cycle options with respect to sustainability, proliferation risk, commercial viability, waste management, and energy security to define the future of nuclear power.},

The reactor and the processing plant are planned as an integral system. The main functions of the processing plant will be to isolate 233Pa from the neutron flux and to remove the rare-earth fission products. The processing method being developed involves the selective chemical reduction of the various components into liquid bismuth solutions at 600°C, utilizing multistage counter-current extraction. Protactinium, which is easily separated from uranium, thorium, and the rare earths, would be trapped in the salt phase in a storage tank located between two extraction contactors and allowed to decay to 233U. Rare earths would be separated from thorium by a similar reductive extraction method; however, this operation will not be as simple as the protactinium isolation step because the rare-earth-thorium separation factors are only 1.3 to 3.5. The proposed process would employ electrolytic cells to simultaneously introduce reductant into the bismuth phase at the cathode and to return extracted materials to the salt phase at the anode. The practicability of the reductive extraction process depends on the successful development of salt-metal contactors, electrolytic cells, and suitable materials of construction.},

	abstract = {In this article, an easy to implement global variance reduction procedure is demonstrated. The procedure is capable of flattening the relative error distribution in a global mesh tally covering the geometry of a complex system. The method is fully based on the I/O capabilities of the {MCNP} Monte Carlo radiation transport code family and requires little additional support code and almost no user judgment to work properly. Increases, with respect to a standard simulation, in a global figure of merit ranging up to a factor 276 for a {PWR} core configuration have been observed. Also, the relative error distribution was flattened substantially in all studied systems by the application of the procedure and the number of empty mesh tally cells was reduced.},

	abstract = {Fuel cycle simulators are used worldwide to provide scientiﬁc assessment to fuel cycle future strategies. Those tools help understanding the fuel cycle physics and determining the most impacting drivers at the cycle scale. A standard scenario calculation is usually based on a set of operational assumptions, such as reactor Burn-Up, deployment history, cooling time, etc. Scenario output is then the evolution of isotopes mass in the facilities that composes the nuclear ﬂeet. The increase of computing capacities and the use of neutron data fast predictors provide new opportunities in nuclear scenario studies. Indeed, a very high number of calculations is possible, which allows testing a high number of operational assumptions combinations. The global sensitivity analysis ({GSA}) formalism is speciﬁcally well adapted for this kind of problem. In this new framework, a scenario study is based on the sampling of operational data, which become input variables. A ﬁrst result of a scenario study is the highlight of relations between operational input data and outputs. Input variable subspace that satisfy optimization criteria on an output, such as plutonium incineration or stabilization, can also be determined. In this paper, a focus is made on the methodology based on {GSA}. This innovative methodology is presented and applied to a simple ﬂeet simulation composed of a {PWR}-{UOx} fuel and a {PWR}-{MOx} fuel. Calculations are done with the fuel cycle simulator {CLASS} developed by the {CNRS}/{IN}2P3 in collaboration with {IRSN}. The design of experiment is built from ﬁve fuel cycle input sampled variables. Sensitivity indices have been calculated on plutonium and minor actinide ({MA}) production. It shows that the {PWR}-{UOx} Burn-Up and the fraction of {PWR}-{MOx} fuel are the most important input variables that explain the plutonium production. For the {MA} production, main drivers depend strongly on isotopes. Sensitivity analysis also reveals input variable subspace responsible of simulation crash, what led to an important improvement of the model algorithms. An equilibrium condition on the plutonium mass in the stockpile used for building {MOx} fuel has been applied. The solution is represented as a subspace in the {PWR}-{UOx} Burn-Up and {PWR}-{MOx} fraction input space. For instance, achieving a plutonium equilibrium in a stockpile fed by a {PWR}-{UOx} that operates at 40 {GWd}/t requires a {PWR}-{MOx} fraction between 9 and 14\%. This study also provides data related to plutonium incineration induced by the utilization of the {MOx}.},

Each way was proved to give extraction efficiency close to unity in a moderate time.},

Many countries worldwide contribute to this reactor technology, among which the European Union, France, Japan, Russia and the {USA}, and for the past few years China and India have also contributed. In general, the international R\&D focuses on three main lines of research. The {USA} focuses on the {FHR}, which will be a nearer-term application of liquid salt as a reactor coolant, while China also focuses on solid fuel reactors as a precursor to molten salt reactors with liquid fuel and a thermal neutron spectrum. The {EU}, France and Russia are focusing on the development of a fast spectrum molten salt reactor capable of either breeding or transmutation of actinides from spent nuclear fuel. Future research topics focus on liquid salt technology and materials behavior, the fuel and fuel cycle chemistry and modeling, and the numerical simulation and safety design aspects of the reactor. {MSR} development attracts more and more attention every year, because it is generally considered as most sustainable of the six Generation-{IV} designs with intrinsic safety features.

The fluid fuel in these reactors, consisting of {UF}4 and {ThF}4 dissolved in fluorides of beryllium and lithium, is circulated through a reactor core moderated by graphite. Technology developments over the past 20 years have culminated in the successful operation of the 8-{MW}(th) {MoltenSalt} Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}), and have indicated that operation with a molten fuel is practical, that the salt is stable under reactor conditions, and that corrosion is very low. Processing of the {MSRE} fuel has demonstrated the {MSR} processing associated with high-performance converters. New fuel processing methods under development should permit {MSR}’s to operate as economical breeders. These features, combined with high thermal efficiency (44\%) and low primary system pressure, give {MSR} converters and breeders potentially favorable economic, fuel utilization, and safety characteristics. Further, these reactors can be initially fueled with 233U, 235U, or plutonium. The construction cost of an {MSBR} power plant is estimated to be about the same as that of light-water reactors. This could lend to power costs 0.5 to 1.0 mill/{kWh} less than those for light-water reactors. Achievement of economic molten-salt breeder reactors requires the construction and operation of several reactors of increasing size and their associated processing plants.},

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, a number of reinforcement learning techniques have emerged, and different reinforcement learning-based applications have proliferated. However, such techniques tend to specialize in a particular field. This is an obstacle to their generalization and extrapolation to other areas. Besides, neither the reward-punishment (r-p) learning process nor the convergence of results is fast and efficient enough. To address these obstacles, this research proposes a general reinforcement learning model. This model is independent of input and output types and based on general bioinspired principles that help to speed up the learning process. The model is composed of a perception module based on sensors whose specific perceptions are mapped as perception patterns. In this manner, similar perceptions (even if perceived at different positions in the environment) are accounted for by the same perception pattern. Additionally, the model includes a procedure that statistically associates perception-action pattern pairs depending on the positive or negative results output by executing the respective action in response to a particular perception during the learning process. To do this, the model is fitted with a mechanism that reacts positively or negatively to particular sensory stimuli in order to rate results. The model is supplemented by an action module that can be configured depending on the maneuverability of each specific agent. The model has been applied in the air navigation domain, a field with strong safety restrictions, which led us to implement a simulated system equipped with the proposed model. Accordingly, the perception sensors were based on Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast ({ADS}-B) technology, which is described in this paper. The results were quite satisfactory, and it outperformed traditional methods existing in the literature with respect to learning reliability and efficiency.},

	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0048v1},
	doi = {10.1613/jair.1437},
	abstract = {In this paper, we confront the problem of applying reinforcement learning to
agents that perceive the environment through many sensors and that can perform
parallel actions using many actuators as is the case in complex autonomous
robots. We argue that reinforcement learning can only be successfully applied
to this case if strong assumptions are made on the characteristics of the
environment in which the learning is performed, so that the relevant sensor
readings and motor commands can be readily identified. The introduction of such
assumptions leads to strongly-biased learning systems that can eventually lose
the generality of traditional reinforcement-learning algorithms. In this line,
we observe that, in realistic situations, the reward received by the robot
depends only on a reduced subset of all the executed actions and that only a
reduced subset of the sensor inputs (possibly different in each situation and
for each action) are relevant to predict the reward. We formalize this property
in the so called 'categorizability assumption' and we present an algorithm that
takes advantage of the categorizability of the environment, allowing a decrease
in the learning time with respect to existing reinforcement-learning
algorithms. Results of the application of the algorithm to a couple of
simulated realistic-robotic problems (landmark-based navigation and the
six-legged robot gait generation) are reported to validate our approach and to
compare it to existing flat and generalization-based reinforcement-learning
approaches.},

We apply shaped rewards to local components and use a simple learning algorithm at each sen- sor in order to maximize those rewards. Our results show that the measurements from a sensor network trained us- ing shaped rewards are up to two orders of magnitude more accurate than a sensor network trained with a traditional global reward. Further, the algorithm proposed scales well to large networks, and is robust to measurement noise and sensor failures.},

The systems selected for development are the very high-temperature gas-cooled reactor ({VHTR}), the sodium-cooled fast reactor ({SFR}), the gas-cooled fast reactor ({GFR}), the lead-cooled fast reactor ({LFR}), the molten salt reactor ({MSR}) and the super-critical water-cooled reactor ({SCWR}). {UK} organisations plan to contribute to the first three of these systems because of its existing capabilities and experience with gas-cooled systems, graphite cores, and {SFRs}. The science base for the {VHTR} and {SFR} systems is reasonably established, although there are gaps. For the {VHTR}, these include the performance of graphite at high neutron doses, and the performance of the fuel. For the {SFR}, the behaviour of fuels containing minor actinides, and processes for their recycling and refabrication into new fuel, must be established. The {GFR} presents many technical challenges, because it would need fuel and structural materials capable of withstanding extremes of fast neutron flux and high temperatures. Adequate heat removal from the core under fault conditions is likely to determine its feasibility.},

	abstract = {Thermal power plants constitute the largest proportion of installed capability in global power generation system, which consumes large quantities of coal. Therefore achieving optimal operation of thermal power units, improving its efficiency and reducing the coal consumption is of great significance for the reduction of greenhouse gas and pollutants emissions. Modelling and simulation is the base of optimal operation and control in thermal power unit and plays an important role in energy saving in thermal power plants. In this paper, research results of modelling and simulation of thermal power units are reviewed. Firstly, several common models which are used for researches of thermal power control systems are analyzed, including simplified turbine and furnace models for unit coordinated control system ({CCS}) as well as local equipment models; Then the system structure, function and application of thermal power stimulated simulator are described; Finally, the structure and function of digital power plant is introduced. The challenges of modelling and simulation of thermal power plant researches in the future are discussed.},

Accordingly it is very important to collect {HRA} data from diverse sources as much as possible, which should be done based on a firm technical underpinning. In this regard, Park et al. proposed a novel framework that allows us to systematically calculate the number of task opportunities from the investigation reports reflecting the operation experience of domestic nuclear power plants [1]. In this study, based on the proposed framework, the nominal {HEPs} of 15 task types are quantified based on the number of task opportunities calculated from the 13 investigation reports stemming from diverse human errors. Although there are several limitations to be technically resolved, the results of this study are meaningful because we are able to take the first step in securing {HRA} data from investigation reports that reflect the operation experience of domestic {NPPs}.},

In this work, the development of an integrated power plant model is presented. This model is validated against steady-state data from a subcritical power plant with reheat and regenerative cycles. The coal-fired power plant model studied has nominal power generation of 605MW and efficiency of 38.3\%. Traditional, regulatory control architectures are incorporated into and tuned with the dynamic power plant model. Dynamic simulation shows that the plant model is stable for sudden changes in coal load, and the controllers are able to maintain the controlled variables at their set points. In this two-part publication, we present the complete workflow of data collection, model development and validation, control tuning, dynamic optimization formulation and solution, and supervisory control architecture for a coal-fired subcritical power plant. Part I focuses on elements of model development and analysis, illustrating the advantages of acausal, object-oriented modeling in power plant simulation.

	abstract = {The modeling and simulation functional needs to license and design molten salt reactor concepts were assessed and an evaluation methodology was developed using a licensing-focused approach considering the modeling and simulation components that contribute to a molten salt reactor safety analysis report. These functional needs were prioritized by identifying the relationships between functional needs and using a quantitative weighting method to identify the most critical components to build a licensing case. This novel weighting method provided a list of functional needs prioritized relative to key advanced reactor licensing outcomes. In addition, functional need inputs were ranked to reveal those that feed the most modeling and simulation components. The findings from this prioritization effort were used to inform the modeling and simulation goals of the {US} Department of Energy Office of Nuclear Energy ({DOE}-{NE}) Molten Salt Reactor campaign. Modeling and simulation needs were grouped into three main categories: (1)source term definition, material accountancy, and radiological consequences, (2)safety analysis, and (3)steady-state neutronics and thermal hydraulics. Five near-term goals were identified among these focus areas that add value: (1) deploying a systems and safeguards analysis computational tool, (2) defining source terms for molten salt reactor analysis and interfacing with the {US} Nuclear Regulatory Commission on accident progression analysis, (3) developing point designs for liquid-fueled thermal-spectrum and fast-spectrum molten salt reactors, (4) building safety analysis specifications and reference solutions for Molten Salt Reactor Experiment transients, and (5)interfacing with the thermophysical and thermodynamic salt chemistry databases.},

	abstract = {The Monte Carlo ({MC}) method is becoming popular for three-dimensional fuel depletion analyses to compute quantities of interest in used nuclear fuel including isotopic compositions. However, there are some questions concerning the effect of {MC} uncertainties on predicted results in {MC} depletion calculations. The {MC} method introduces stochastic uncertainty in the computed fluxes. These fluxes are used to collapse cross sections, estimate power distributions, and deplete the fuel within depletion calculations; therefore, the predicted number densities also contain random and propagated uncertainties due to the {MC} solution to the neutron transport equation.The linear uncertainty nuclide group approximation ({LUNGA}) method was developed to calculate the propagated stochastic uncertainty in the nuclear isotopics, using the time-varying flux subjected to the power normalization constraint. Verification of the {LUNGA} method demonstrated that the standard deviation in the number densities and infinite multiplication factor (kinf) predicted by this method agree well with the uncertainty obtained from the statistical analysis of 100 different simulations performed with coupled {MC} depletion calculations.Future research includes (a) expanding the {LUNGA} methodology to include more nuclides, (b) fully automating the methodology, and (c) investigating the use of an axial segmented fuel rod.},

	abstract = {A new formulation aimed at quantifying uncertainties of Monte Carlo ({MC}) tallies such as keff and the microscopic reaction rates as well as nuclide number density estimates in {MC} depletion analysis is presented. It is shown that when the two major {MC} inputs - the microscopic cross sections and nuclide number densities - are assumed to have uncertainties, the variance of a given {MC} tally used as a measure of its uncertainty in this formulation arises from four sources: the statistical uncertainty of the {MC} tally, uncertainties of microscopic cross sections and nuclide number densities, and the cross correlations between them and the latter three contributions can be determined by computing correlation coefficients between uncertain variables. It is also shown that the variance of any given nuclide number density at the end of each depletion time step ({DTS}) stems from uncertainties of the nuclide number densities and microscopic reaction rates of nuclides at the beginning of each {DTS}, and they are determined by computing correlation coefficients between these two uncertain variables. The new formulation is incorporated into the Monte Carlo Code for Advanced Reactor Design ({McCARD}) of Seoul National University, and a {McCARD} depletion analysis for a U-{TRU}-Zr fuel assembly is performed to examine quantitatively the uncertainty propagation behavior of {MC} tallies such as k∞ and the number densities of actinides as a function of {DTS}. The results demonstrate that the formulation is useful not only for quantifying the uncertainty propagation analysis in {MC} depletion analysis but also for identifying the types of nuclear cross-section data that need to be improved to obtain a more reliable incineration physics analysis of the transuranium fuel.},

	abstract = {An important niche for nuclear energy is the need for power at remote locations
removed from a reliable electrical grid. Nuclear energy has potential applications at
strategic defense locations, theaters of battle, remote communities, and emergency
locations. With proper safeguards, a 1 to 10-{MWe} (megawatt electric) mobile reactor
system could provide robust, self-contained, and long-term power in any environment.
Heat pipe-cooled fast-spectrum nuclear reactors have been identified as a candidate
for these applications. Heat pipe reactors, using alkali metal heat pipes, are perfectly
suited for mobile applications because their nature is inherently simpler, smaller, and
more reliable than “traditional” reactors.
The goal of this project was to develop a scalable conceptual design for a compact
reactor and to identify scaling issues for compact heat pipe cooled reactors in general.
Toward this goal two detailed concepts were developed, the first concept with more
conventional materials and a power of about 2 {MWe} and a the second concept with
less conventional materials and a power level of about 5 {MWe}. A series of more
qualitative advanced designs were developed (with less detail) that show power levels
can be pushed to approximately 30 {MWe}.},

characteristics include a relatively small footprint, passively safe operation, and a self-contained
geometry, providing a plug-and-go power source for remote installations and communities. This concept
uniquely features an array of in-core heat pipes for passive heat transfer, thus avoiding traditional primary
circuit equipment and eliminating severe accident scenarios of loss-of-forced-cooling. Plus, the large
number of in-core heat pipes provides built-in redundancy in the event of a single heat pipe failure.
The Phenomena Identification and Ranking Table ({PIRT}) technique was
conducted on the Special Purpose Reactor nuclear plant design. The {PIRT} is a
structured process to identify safety-relevant/safety-significant phenomena and
assess the importance and knowledge base by ranking the phenomena. The
Special Purpose Reactor is currently in the conceptual design phase. The
candidate reactor has a solid monolithic stainless steel core with an array of heat
pipes and fuel pellets embedded in the monolith. The heat pipes are used to

	abstract = {The driving forces in the development of {SMRs} are their specific characteristics. They can be deployed
incrementally to closely match increasing energy demand resulting in a moderate financial commitment for
countries or regions with smaller electricity grids. {SMRs} show the promise of significant cost reduction
through modularization and factory construction which should further improve the construction schedule and
reduce costs. In the area of wider applicability {SMR} designs and sizes are better suited for partial or
dedicated use in non-electrical applications such as providing heat for industrial processes, hydrogen
production or sea-water desalination. Process heat or cogeneration results in significantly improved thermal
efficiencies leading to a better return on investment. Some {SMR} designs may also serve niche markets, for
example to burn nuclear waste.
Booklets on the status of {SMR} technology developments have been published in 2012, 2014 and 2016. The
objective is to provide Member States with a concise overview of the latest status of {SMR} designs. This
booklet is reporting the advances in design and technology developments of {SMRs} of all the major
technology lines within the category of {SMRs}. It covers land based and marine based water-cooled reactors,
high temperature gas cooled reactors, liquid metal, sodium and gas-cooled fast neutron spectrum reactors and
molten salt reactors. The content on the specific {SMRs} is provided by the responsible institute or

To ensure structural integrity and minimize the risk to plant investment, a potential limitation of fuel-element life may result from graphite corrosion in the high-temperature regions of the core (T ≅ 1100 °C). This corrosion is caused primarily by reactions of graphite with the low concentrations of steam (0.01–0.1 ppm) that are normally present in the helium coolant Economical operation of the reactor requires that the steam concentrations be maintained at such low levels that corrosion rates will not impact the normal fuel cycle. In this paper, we develop a graphite-corrosion model and address this important practical problem.},

After a cyber-attack, the configuration of network switches is changed to isolate the compromised {PMUs}/phasor data concentrators to prevent further propagation of the attack; meanwhile, the disconnected yet uncompromised {PMUs} will be reconnected to the network to “self-heal” and thus restore the observability of the power system. Specifically, we formulate an integer linear programming model to minimize the overhead of the self-healing process (e.g., the recovery latency), while considering the constraints of power system observability, hardware resources, and network topology. We also propose a heuristic algorithm to decrease the computational complexity. Case studies of a {PMU} network based on the {IEEE} 30-bus and 118-bus systems are used to validate the effectiveness of the self-healing mechanism.},

The California Department of Motor Vehicles ({DMV}) reports that between 2014 and 2017, manufacturers tested 144 {AVs}, driving a cumulative 1,116,605 autonomous miles, and reported 5,328 disengagements and 42 accidents involving {AVs} on public roads. This paper investigates the causes, dynamics, and impacts of such {AV} failures by analyzing disengagement and accident reports obtained from public {DMV} databases. We draw several conclusions. For example, we find that autonomous vehicles are 15 - 4000Ã- worse than human drivers for accidents per cumulative mile driven; that drivers of {AVs} need to be as alert as drivers of non-{AVs}; and that the {AVs}' machine-learning-based systems for perception and decision-and-control are the primary cause of 64\% of all disengagements.},

Researchers and engineers have created many novel methods to inject faults, which can be implemented in both hardware and software. The contrast between the hardware and software methods lies mainly in the fault injection points they can access, the cost and the level of perturbation. Hardware methods can inject faults into chip pins and internal components, such as combinational circuits and registers that are not software-addressable. On the other hand, software methods are convenient for directly producing changes at the software-state level. Thus, we use hardware methods to evaluate low-level error detection and masking mechanisms, and software methods to test higher level mechanisms. Software methods are less expensive, but they also incur a higher perturbation overhead because they execute software on the target system.},

	abstract = {A coupled thermalhydraulic-neutronic extended criterion developed in order to assess the conditions of static instability of the sodium flow in a {SFR} core during the beginning of an unprotected loss of flow ({ULOF}) is presented in the first part of this paper. This extended criterion takes into account the evolution of the pressure drop in a sub-assembly ({SA}) as well as the evolution of its power when the reactor is affected by a flow rate (or power) perturbation by starting from a steady-state. The considered steady states are typical of quasi-steady states reached by a {SFR} during a {ULOF}. The temporal evolution of the flow and the temporal evolution of the power can be represented by a system of two differential equations whose linear stability analysis has enabled to define the aforementioned extended criterion. Then, in the second part of the paper, a verification of this extended criterion is performed by simulating the behavior of a {GEN} {IV} {SFR} of 1500 {MWth}. Four various steady states of the reactor have been investigated with a simulation tool devoted to unprotected loss of flow simulations ({MACARENa}). First simulations have enabled to calculate the various physical parameters needed to check the extended criterion. Perturbations have been applied to these four states. The extended criterion, proposed in this paper, has predicted flow stabilization for 3 states whereas it has predicted a flow excursion (sudden flow rate decrease leading to {SA} dry-out) for the last state. In this latter case, the classical Ledinegg criterion, which relies only on pressure drop evolution at constant power, has predicted a stable configuration. Then, the extended criterion predictions have been verified with {MACARENa} simulations, by slightly and temporary reducing the driving pressure head of the flow rate in the studied {SA} from each of the four initial states. For stable states, when setting again the pressure head of the flow to the value of the initial state, the initial flow rate is recovered. For the last initial state (predicted as unstable by the extended criterion), after a convergence period carried-out by imposing the {SA} steady flow rate, the solving of the transient momentum equation have shown that a flow excursion occurs in the {MACARENa} simulation as expected from the extended criterion. Consequently, the extended criterion proposed in this paper has been verified and could enable to define stable and unstable domain of couple flow rate/power in order to design future cores.},

	abstract = {Babcock and Wilcox (B\&W) has been producing high quality uranium oxycarbide ({UCO}) kernels for Advanced Gas Reactor ({AGR}) fuel tests at the Idaho National Laboratory. In 2005, 350-μm, 19.7\% 235U-enriched {UCO} kernels were produced for the {AGR}-1 test fuel. Following coating of these kernels and forming the coated-particles into compacts, this fuel was irradiated in the Advanced Test Reactor ({ATR}) from December 2006 until November 2009. B\&W produced 425-μm, 14\% enriched {UCO} kernels in 2008, and these kernels were used to produce fuel for the {AGR}-2 experiment that was inserted in {ATR} in 2010. B\&W also produced 500μm, 9.6\% enriched {UO}2 kernels for the {AGR}-2 experiment. Kernels of the same size and enrichment as {AGR}-1 were also produced for the {AGR}-3/4 experiment. In addition to fabricating enriched {UCO} and {UO}2 kernels, B\&W has produced more than 100 kg of natural uranium {UCO} kernels which are being used in coating development tests. Successive lots of kernels have demonstrated consistent high quality and also allowed for fabrication process improvements. Improvements in kernel forming were made subsequent to {AGR}-1 kernel production. Following fabrication of {AGR}-2 kernels, incremental increases in sintering furnace charge size have been demonstrated. Recently small scale sintering tests using a small development furnace equipped with a residual gas analyzer ({RGA}) have increased understanding of how kernel sintering parameters affect sintered kernel properties. The steps taken to increase throughput and process knowledge have reduced kernel production costs. Studies have been performed of additional modifications toward the goal of increasing capacity of the current fabrication line to use for production of first core fuel for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant ({NGNP}) and providing a basis for the design of a full scale fuel fabrication facility.},

	abstract = {Fission products deposited in the coolant circuit outside of the active core play a dominant role in source term estimations for advanced small pebble bed {HTRs}, particularly in design basis accidents ({DBA}). The deposited fission products may be released in depressurization accidents because present pebble bed {HTR} concepts abstain from a gas tight containment. Contamination of the circuit also hinders maintenance work. Experiments, performed from 1972 to 88 on the {AVR}, an experimental pebble bed {HTR}, allow for a deeper insight into fission product transport behavior. The activity deposition per coolant pass was lower than expected and was influenced by fission product chemistry and by presence of carbonaceous dust. The latter lead also to inconsistencies between Cs plate out experiments in laboratory and in {AVR}. The deposition behavior of Ag was in line with present models. Dust as activity carrier is of safety relevance because of its mobility and of its sorption capability for fission products. All metal surfaces in pebble bed reactors were covered by a carbonaceous dust layer. Dust in {AVR} was produced by abrasion in amounts of about 5Ã¢Â€Â‰kg/y. Additional dust sources in {AVR} were ours oil ingress and peeling of fuel element surfaces due to an air ingress. Dust has a size of about 1Ã¢Â€Â‰ ÃŽÂ¼m, consists mainly of graphite, is partly remobilized by flow perturbations, and deposits with time constants of 1 to 2Ã¢Â€Â‰h ours. In future reactors, an efficient filtering via a gas tight containment is required because accidents with fast depressurizations induce dust mobilization. Enhanced core temperatures in normal operation as in {AVR} and broken fuel pebbles have to be considered, as inflammable dust concentrations in the gas phase.},

It then describes the severe accident scenarios that are the greatest challenge to high temperature gas cooled reactor safety: ingress of air or water into the core. Then, the paper offers an overview of what could be learned from the experiences with high temperature gas cooled reactors that have been built; their operating history indicates differences between actual operations and theoretical behavior. Finally, the paper describes some of the multiple priorities that often drive reactor design, and how safety is compromised in the process of optimizing other priorities.},

The requirement for load following was to have a ramp rate of 5\% per minute when the turbine-generator power level ramps down from full power to 25\% power level and back to full power. The control approach, which pairs selected manipulated variables namely the: reactor control rods; helium circulator speed; feed water pump speed; turbine throttle valve to selected controlled variables namely the: reactor outlet temperature; main steam temperature; main steam pressure; turbine-generator power, is discussed in this paper. The controller actions on the manipulated variables and their response during the load following signal are illustrated. The deviation of the controlled variables during load following are shown within their required limits.

	abstract = {Argonne has developed {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 models for the benchmark analyses of the Experimental Breeder Reactor {II} ({EBR}-{II}) Balance-of-Plant ({BOP}) tests that represented protected and unprotected loss of heat sink conditions. Some assumptions had to be made for the models because of uncertainties related to the cooling system. In addition, the reactivity feedback coefficients also have uncertainties due to the nuclear data. These uncertainties may contribute to discrepancies observed between the simulation results and the measured data. The objective of this study is to apply the recently developed coupling between Dakota and {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 to investigate the impact of uncertainties on the simulation results. The sensitivity analysis helps determine the prioritization of future R\&D efforts. Dakota is an uncertainty quantification and optimization toolkit. It was coupled with {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 via a Python interface to meet an increased need to perform sensitivity analyses and uncertainty quantification in the advanced reactor domain. Dakota was used to sample userspecified parameters, drive {SAS}4A/{SASSYS}-1 transient simulations, and quantify statistical metrics as part of post processing. The studies described in this paper include the uncertainty quantification of the {EBR}-{II} simulations and calibration between the simulation results and the experimental data. By applying Dakota for uncertainty propagation, it is found that the radial expansion, control rod drive expansion, and stagnant sodium mixing models have significant impacts on the benchmark results. Following the uncertainty quantification, parameters in the {EBR}-{II} model that were identified to have significant impacts were optimized by Dakota in order to assess the magnitude of changes needed to improve the simulation results.},

	abstract = {Ensuring sustainability demands more efficient energy management with minimized energy wastage. Therefore, the power grid of the future should provide an unprecedented level of flexibility in energy management. To that end, intelligent decision making requires accurate predictions of future energy demand/load, both at aggregate and individual site level. Thus, energy load forecasting have received increased attention in the recent past. However, it has proven to be a difficult problem. This paper presents a novel energy load forecasting methodology based on Deep Neural Networks, specifically, Long Short Term Memory ({LSTM}) algorithms. The presented work investigates two {LSTM} based architectures: 1) standard {LSTM} and 2) {LSTM}-based Sequence to Sequence (S2S) architecture. Both methods were implemented on a benchmark data set of electricity consumption data from one residential customer. Both architectures were trained and tested on one hour and one-minute time-step resolution datasets. Experimental results showed that the standard {LSTM} failed at one-minute resolution data while performing well in one-hour resolution data. It was shown that S2S architecture performed well on both datasets. Further, it was shown that the presented methods produced comparable results with the other deep learning methods for energy forecasting in literature.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a recurrent neural network model to make medium-to-long term predictions, i.e. time horizon of ⩾1 week, of electricity consumption profiles in commercial and residential buildings at one-hour resolution. Residential and commercial buildings are responsible for a significant fraction of the overall energy consumption in the U.S. With advances in sensors and smart technologies, there is a need for medium to long-term prediction of electricity consumption in residential and commercial buildings at hourly intervals to support decision making pertaining to operations, demand response strategies, and installation of distributed generation systems. The modeler may have limited access to information about building’s schedules and equipment, making data-driven machine learning models attractive. The energy consumption data that is available may also contain blocks of missing data, making time-series predictions difficult. Thus, the main objectives of this paper are: (a) Develop and optimize novel deep recurrent neural network ({RNN}) models aimed at medium to long term electric load prediction at one-hour resolution; (b) Analyze the relative performance of the model for different types of electricity consumption patterns; and (c) Use the deep {NN} to perform imputation on an electricity consumption dataset containing segments of missing values. The proposed models were used to predict hourly electricity consumption for the Public Safety Building in Salt Lake City, Utah, and for aggregated hourly electricity consumption in residential buildings in Austin, Texas. For predicting the commercial building’s load profiles, the proposed {RNN} sequence-to-sequence models generally correspond to lower relative error when compared with the conventional multi-layered perceptron neural network. For predicting aggregate electricity consumption in residential buildings, the proposed model generally does not provide gains in accuracy compared to the multi-layered perceptron model.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) with its liquid circulating fuel and its fast neutron spectrum calls for a new safety approach including technological neutral methodologies and analysis tools adapted to early design phases. In the frame of the Horizon2020 program {SAMOFAR} (Safety Assessment of the Molten Salt Fast Reactor) a safety approach suitable for Molten Salt Reactors is being developed and applied to the {MSFR}. After a description of the {MSFR} reference design, this paper focuses on the identification of the Postulated Initiating Events ({PIEs}), which is a core part of the global assessment methodology. To fulfil this task, the Functional Failure Mode and Effect Analysis ({FFMEA}) and the Master Logic Diagram ({MLD}) are selected and employed separately in order to be as exhaustive as possible in the identification of the initiating events of the system. Finally, an extract of the list of {PIEs}, selected as the most representative events resulting from the implementation of both methods, is presented to illustrate the methodology and some of the outcomes of the methods are compared in order to highlight symbioses and differences between the {MLD} and the {FFMEA}.},

The coupling between multi-group neutron transport equations and the delayed neutron precursor balance equations are considered with using the finite volume method. By introducing the inverse power method to the {OpenFOAM}, the k-eigenvalue problems are calculated, and by coupling the neutron transport and delayed neutron precursor calculations using the Euler implicit scheme, the transient kinetics problems are simulated. Numerical results show that the proposed {ntkFoam} can simulate the multi-group neutron transport kinetics problem accurately and flexibility, and both the regular and irregular mesh configurations can be adopted.

To confirm the stability and the reliability of the system, the current and voltage level must be regained after occurrence of the fault in the system. By conducting {MATLAB} Simulink simulation, we have shown the voltage and current scenario of the load side during the normal and abnormal condition. The simulation results ensure the resiliency of the {MEG} after abnormal condition without affecting the consumer level. The results also confirm the regularity of the power flow to the load (electrical) side during normal as well as fault condition.},

	title = {Reservoir Computing: Memory, Nonlinearity, and Spatial Observers},
	abstract = {Reservoir computers are a subset of neural networks that behave as a dynamical
system rather than a function. This makes reservoir computers uniquely suited to
solving problems that involve time series data, but how they do so is not well understood. This thesis covers the background and implementation of reservoir computers,
before discussing the effects of linear memory and nonlinear computational ability.
We use reservoir computers with either exclusively linear memory, a combination of
linear memory and nonlinear computational ability, or exclusively nonlinear computational ability. As a first task, we show that these reservoir computers can act as
observers for the Lorenz and R¨ossler chaotic systems, i.e. they are able to predict
unobserved dynamical variables of these systems. We find that while the reservoir
with a combination of linear memory and nonlinear computation usually performs
better as an observer, for some tasks either linear memory or nonlinear computation
is not necessary to accurately make inferences about the system. Next, the linear
and combination linear/nonlinear reservoirs were tasked with “learning” the Lorenz
or R¨ossler attractor. The combination reservoir was able to learn the attractors, but
the linear reservoir was not. Lastly, coupled map lattice dynamics were generated
experimentally and in silico, and used to see if reservoir computers with a nonlinear
activation function could function as observers for a dataset with spatial extent. We
found an optimized parameter set that enabled the reservoir computer to predict the
dynamics of the unobserved nodes of a 1D lattice when given the dynamics of a few
nodes within the lattice. We found that, in principle, the reservoir could also function
as an observer for a 2D lattice, though the spatiotemporal dynamics of our particular
2D lattice were too complex for any reservoir size we used.},

	abstract = {Global energy consumption is expected to increase significantly due to the growth of the economy and population. The utilization of fossil resource, especially coal, will likely be constrained by carbon dioxide emissions, known to be the principal contributor to climate change. Therefore, the world is facing the challenge of how to utilize fossil resource without a large carbon footprint. In the present work, a nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is proposed as a potential solution to the aforementioned challenge. A high-carbon energy such as coal is integrated effectively with a low-carbon energy such as nuclear in a flexible and optimized manner, which is able to generate the chemicals and fuels with low carbon dioxide emissions. The nuclear–coal hybrid energy system is presented in this paper for the detailed analysis. In this case, the carbon resource required by the fuel syntheses and chemical production processes is mainly provided by coal while the hydrogen resource is derived from nuclear energy. Such integration can not only lead to a good balance between carbon and hydrogen, but also improve both energy and carbon efficiencies. More importantly, a significantly lower {CO}2 emission intensity is achieved. A systematic techno-economic model is established, and a scenario analysis is carried out on the hybrid system to assess the economic competitiveness based on the considerations of various types of externalities. It is found that with the rising carbon tax and coal price as well as the decreasing cost of nuclear energy, the hybrid energy system will become more and more economically competitive with the conventional option, which make it a potential viable solution for the future carbon-constrained world.},

Renewable energy sources are not continuous, dependent upon geographical location as well as climatic conditions, and require a very large land footprint. Future of nuclear energy is also uncertain because of public apprehensions and subsequent government policies. To overcome the issues derailing these two virtually carbon-free energy sources, a new hybrid or integrated nuclear-renewable energy system is being proposed and seen as an attractive option. Such integrated energy systems are conceived as a nuclear power reactor coupled with renewable energy generation and industrial processes that may simultaneously tackle the concerns regarding grid flexibility, climate change, energy security, optimal return on invested capital, and settling public concerns. Apart from highlighting the key challenges associated with nuclear energy and renewable energy sources while operating as an independent power generation system, the present paper delineates the various aspects associated with integrated nuclear-renewable energy systems. It may be speculated that integrating nuclear energy and renewable energy into a single hybrid energy system, coupled through informatics linkages, would enable to overcome the demerits present when they operate individual.},

	abstract = {Improving computer technology and the desire to more accurately model the heterogeneity of the nuclear reactor environment have made the use  
of Monte Carlo depletion codes more attractive in recent years, and feasible (if not practical) even for 3-D depletion simulation.  However, in this case statistical uncertainty is combined with error propagating through the calculation from previous steps.  In an effort to understand this error propagation, four test problems were developed to test error propagation in  
the fuel assembly and core domains.  Three test cases modeled and tracked individual fuel pins in four 17x17 {PWR} fuel assemblies.  A fourth problem  
modeled a well-characterized 330MWe nuclear reactor core.  By changing the code's initial random number seed, the data produced by a series of 19 replica runs of each test case was used to investigate the true and apparent variance in k-eff, pin powers, and number densities of several isotopes. While this study does not intend to develop a predictive model for error  
propagation, it is hoped that its results can help to identify some common regularities in the behavior of uncertainty in several key parameters.},

In France, nuclear is the first contributor to today's low-carbon power mix and it will, tomorrow, be challenged by the increase of variable renewable energy sources. This paper develops a prospective approach to examine the solicitations that nuclear will have to face, for several scenarios. Results show that, with the penetration of renewable energy sources, the number of extreme nuclear power ramps and amplitudes variations increase, as well as the number of annually required shut-downs/start-ups events per reactor, even if the nuclear capacity was to be lowered. Beyond 30\% wind and solar penetration, complementary flexibility options will have to be leveraged.},

Highlighted phenomena include (i) turbulence-driven secondary flows inside a subchannel, (ii) local turbulent-laminar transition in the narrow gap region, and (iii) global flow pulsation across the gap along the channel length. These phenomena are simulated by Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}). The {CFD} methods employed here are those of Direct Numerical Simulation ({DNS}) of turbulence, Large Eddy Simulation ({LES}) and Reynolds-Averaged Navier–Stokes ({RANS}) equations approach. Complicated turbulent flow structure is due to strong anisotropy in the non-uniform channel geometry that is characterized by wide open channels connected by a narrow gap. The secondary flows in subchannels play an important role in transporting small eddies generated in the wider region toward the narrow gap. Periodic cross-flow oscillations are calculated to appear in the vicinity of the gap region, and the coherent structure is transported in the main flow direction. This macroscopic flow process prevails in the low Re turbulent flow regime and is called as global flow pulsation. Finally a brief discussion is made on their influences onto the mixing between two subchannels that must be taken into account during natural circulation decay heat removals.},

It is the user responsibility to choose one of those models, suitable for the problem studied. In the last decade, several computations were presented using computational fluid dynamics for the simulation of various problems of the nuclear industry. A common feature in a number of those simulations is that they were performed using the standard k–ε turbulence model without justifying the choice of the model. The simulation results were rarely satisfactory. In this paper, we shall consider the flow in a fuel rod bundle as a case study and discuss why the application of the standard k–ε model fails to give reasonable results in this situation. We also show that a turbulence model based on the Reynolds stress transport equations can provide qualitatively correct results. Generally, our aim is pedagogical, we would like to call the readers attention to the fact that turbulence models have to be selected based on theoretical considerations and/or adequate information obtained from measurements.},

In recent years a transition is occurring toward predictive, first-principle-based tools such as computational fluid dynamics. Even with the advent of petascale computing, however, such tools still have significant limitations. In the present work some of these issues, and in particular the presence of massive multiscale separation, are discussed, as well as some of the research conducted to mitigate them. Petascale simulations at high fidelity (large eddy simulation/direct numerical simulation) were conducted with the massively parallel spectral element code Nek5000 on a series of representative problems. These simulations shed light on the requirements of several types of simulation: (1) axial flow around fuel rods, with particular attention to wall effects; (2) natural convection in the primary vessel; and (3) flow in a rod bundle in the presence of spacing devices. The focus of the work presented here is on the lessons learned and the requirements to perform these simulations at exascale. Additional physical insight gained from these simulations is also emphasized.},

	abstract = {The grid-to-rod fretting ({GTRF}) problem in pressurized water reactors is a flow-induced vibration problem that results in wear and failure of the fuel rods in nuclear assemblies. In order to understand the fluid dynamics of {GTRF} and to build an archival database of turbulence statistics for various configurations, implicit large-eddy simulations of time-dependent single-phase turbulent flow have been performed in 3×3 and 5×5 rod bundles with a single grid spacer. To assess the computational mesh and resolution requirements, a method for quantitative assessment of unstructured meshes with no-slip walls is described. The calculations have been carried out using Hydra-{TH}, a thermal-hydraulics code developed at Los Alamos for the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light water reactors, a United States Department of Energy Innovation Hub. Hydra-{TH} uses a second-order implicit incremental projection method to solve the single-phase incompressible Navier–Stokes equations. The simulations explicitly resolve the large scale motions of the turbulent flow field using first principles and rely on a monotonicity-preserving numerical technique to represent the unresolved scales. Each series of simulations for the 3×3 and 5×5 rod-bundle geometries is an analysis of the flow field statistics combined with a mesh-refinement study and validation with available experimental data. Our primary focus is the time history and statistics of the forces loading the fuel rods. These hydrodynamic forces are believed to be the key player resulting in rod vibration and {GTRF} wear, one of the leading causes for leaking nuclear fuel which costs power utilities millions of dollars in preventive measures. We demonstrate that implicit large-eddy simulation of rod-bundle flows is a viable way to calculate the excitation forces for the {GTRF} problem.},

The mathematical model of the {MMNPP} consisting of two small modular reactor units, a steam header and three steam consuming units, (two-to-three {MMNPP}) was developed, including a nonlinear point reactor core model with six-group delayed neutron, an once-through steam generator ({OTSG}) model based on the moving boundary concept and a lumped parameter header model. Then linearization method was applied to the header model to obtain the corresponding transfer function model based on which feedforward compensators for header outlet valves were designed and integrated into the header steam pressure control system. It has been demonstrated by numerical simulation results that the developed header steam pressure control system with valve opening compensators can alleviate the coupling effect among header outlet flowrates, leading to much safer and more stable operations of the {MMNPP} than the existing header steam pressure control system without valve opening compensators. The control strategy given in this paper can be extended to more complex {MMNPPs}.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a numerical study of flow-induced vibration in a helical coil steam generator experiment conducted at Argonne National Laboratory in the 1980s. In the experiment, a half-scale sector model of a steam generator helical coil tube bank was subjected to still and flowing air and water, and the vibrational characteristics were recorded. The research detailed in this document utilizes the multi-physics simulation toolkit {SHARP} developed at Argonne National Laboratory, in cooperation with Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, to simulate the experiment. {SHARP} uses the spectral element code Nek5000 for fluid dynamics analysis and the finite element code {DIABLO} for structural analysis. The flow around the coil tubes is modeled in Nek5000 by using a large eddy simulation turbulence model. Transient pressure data on the tube surfaces is sampled and transferred to {DIABLO} for the structural simulation. The structural response is simulated in {DIABLO} via an implicit time-marching algorithm and a combination of continuum elements and structural shells. Tube vibration data (acceleration and frequency) are sampled and compared with the experimental data. Currently, only one-way coupling is used, which means that pressure loads from the fluid simulation are transferred to the structural simulation but the resulting structural displacements are not fed back to the fluid simulation.},

It can be concluded that the shape and magnitude of the mean vertical velocity component is in excellent agreement for the selected horizontal line plots. Maximum relative errors are less than 10\% until the subchannel walls are approached.

	abstract = {Resolving flow near walls is critical to reproducing the high rates of shear that generate turbulence in high Reynolds number, wall-bounded flows. In the present study, we examine the resolution requirements for correctly reproducing mean flow quantities and wall shear stress distribution in a large eddy simulation using the spectral element method. In this method, derivatives are only guaranteed in a weak sense, and the same is true of quantities composed of derivatives, such as the wall shear stress. We are interested in what is required to resolve the wall shear stress in problems that lack homogeneity in at least one direction. The problem of interest is that of parallel flow through a rod bundle configuration. Several meshes for this problem are systematically compared. In addition, we conduct a study of channel flow in order to examine the issues in a canonical flow that contains spanwise homogeneity missing in rod bundle flow. In the case of channel flow, we compare several meshes and subgrid scale models. We find that typical measures of accuracy, such as the law of the wall, are not sufficient for determining the resolution of quantities that vary along the wall. Spanwise variation of wall shear stress in underresolved flows is characterized by spikes—physical points without well-defined derivatives of the velocity—found at element boundaries. These spikes are not particular to any subgrid scale model and are the unavoidable consequence of underresolution. Accurately reproducing the wall shear stress distribution, while minimizing the computational costs, requires increasing the number of elements along the wall (local h-refinement) and using very high order (N=19) basis functions (p-refinement). We suggest that while these requirements are not easily generalized to grid spacing guidelines, one can apply a general process: construct a mesh that progressively increases elements along any walls, and increase the order of basis functions until the distribution of wall shear stress or any other quantity of interest is smooth.},

	abstract = {Flow-induced vibration ({FIV}) is a widespread problem in energy systems as they rely on fluid movement for energy conversion. Vibrating structures may be damaged as fatigue or wear occur. Given the importance of reliable components in the nuclear industry, {FIV} has long been a major concern in the safety and operation of nuclear reactors. In particular, nuclear fuel rods and steam generators have been known to suffer from {FIV} and related failures.In this paper we discuss the use of the computational fluid dynamics code Nek5000 coupled to the structural code Diablo to simulate the flow in helical coil heat exchangers and associated {FIV}. In particular, one-way coupled calculations are performed, where pressure and tractions data are loaded into the structural model. The main focus of this paper is on validation of this capability. Fluid-only Nek5000 large eddy simulations are first compared against dedicated high-resolution experiments. Then, one-way coupled calculations are performed with Nek5000 and Diablo for two data sets that provide {FIV} data for validation. These calculations were aimed at simulating available legacy {FIV} experiments in helical steam generators in the turbulent buffeting regime. In this regime one-way coupling is judged sufficient since the pressure loads do not cause substantial displacements. It is also the most common source of vibration in helical steam generators at the low flows expected in integral pressurized water reactors. We discuss validation of two-way coupled experiments and benchmarks toward the simulation of fluid elastic instability. We briefly discuss the application of these methods to grid-to-rod fretting.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to modeling the near-wall region in the class of k−ω models. The proposed methodology obviates the need for ad hoc boundary conditions of ω on the wall as typically required in the k−ω model. The primary motivation of this work is to provide a formulation equivalent to the standard k−ω and k−ω {SST} models, but which at the same time overcomes their limitations in the context of their implementation in high-order methods. This is achieved by subtracting the asymptotically known singular behavior of ω at walls. Imposing a grid-dependent value of ω at walls in high-order codes is not straightforward as is demonstrated below and it causes instability as well as accuracy issues. The mathematical formulation of the two novel approaches, termed as the “regularized k−ω model” and the “regularized k−ω {SST} model”, is discussed in detail. A consistency and verification study for these two approaches is performed by proving that the regularized models recover the results of the standard models in various canonical problems, such as turbulent channel and pipe flows, and a systematic investigation of convergence, using both p- (polynomial order) as well as h- (grid) refinement is reported. Furthermore, comparisons highlighting the performance of the proposed methods in more complex configurations such as flow over a backward facing step and the turbulent mixing of fluid streams of different temperatures in a T-junction are also presented.},

First a comparison between the {DNS} calculation and the numerical benchmark results by the spectral method has been made for flows in concentric annuli to demonstrate the accuracy of the {DNS}.

Even with the advent of petascale computing, however, such tools still have significant limitations. In the present work some of these issues, and in particular the presence of massive multiscale separation, are discussed, as well as some of the research conducted to mitigate them. Petascale simulations at high fidelity (large eddy simulation/direct numerical simulation) were conducted with the massively parallel spectral element code Nek5000 on a series of representative problems. These simulations shed light on the requirements of several types of simulation: (1) axial flow around fuel rods, with particular attention to wall effects; (2) natural convection in the primary vessel; and (3) flow in a rod bundle in the presence of spacing devices. The focus of the work presented here is on the lessons learned and the requirements to perform these simulations at exascale. Additional physical insight gained from these simulations is also emphasized.},

In this paper, we review the literature in order to summarise the impacts of the different technologies in terms of their materials and energy requirements, their emissions during operation, their health effects during operation, the accident risks, and the associated waste streams. We follow up these comparisons with some more anecdotal evidence on selected impacts that are either particularly topical or are important but less commonly addressed. These include impacts of wind turbines on persons and on bird life, the underestimated problems with biomass, and concerns about biodiversity reduction. Finally we address the public attitudes towards both renewable energy technologies and to nuclear power. The conclusion is drawn that energy policies of many countries are perhaps more strongly influenced by public and political perceptions of available technologies than they are by rational assessment of the actual benefits and drawbacks. Policy recommendations follow from this conclusion.},

	abstract = {Petroleum and natural gas are mainly used to generate electricity nowadays. However, the emission of greenhouse gas is a concern, and is getting serious year by year. In order to protect our environment, it is imperative to replace the rapid uses of fossil fuel with alternative or renewable energy. Regarding the situation in Hong Kong, if the government want to increase the use rate of solar energy in the long run, the cost is one of the major concerns. Detail knowledge of solar energy cost on the basis of the analysis on materials, duration, maintenance and waste recovery cost are thus necessary. The present study on the cost prediction of solar panel provides an insight on whether solar panels are sustainable in terms of low opportunity cost. The second generation of solar panel material has a lower cost than first generation given the fact that the both generations can have the same lifespan. In addition, the maintenance and duration time of the second generation are also satisfactory. Nevertheless, the waste recovery on the solar panel still need to be improved to achieve highly sustainable to maintain at a low cost. The cost analysis is an important parameter to encourage the citizens to use solar panel for electricity generation particularly after the newly launched feed-in tariff scheme in Hong Kong. Hong Kong nowadays are still more dependent on coal and natural gas to generate electricity energy due to the relative low cost, thus maintaining the solar panel at low and competitive cost promotes the widespread uses of solar energy in future.},

	abstract = {An optimization study of a single-pass transuranic ({TRU}) deep burn ({DB}) has been performed for a block-type modular helium reactor ({MHR}) proposed by General Atomics. A high-burnup {TRU} feed vector from light water reactors is considered: 50 {GWd}/{tU} burnup with 5-yr cooling. For threedimensional equilibrium cores, the performance analysis is done by using {McCARD}, a continuous-energy Monte Carlo depletion code. The core optimization is performed from the viewpoints of the core configuration, fuel management, tristructural-isotropic ({TRISO}) fuel specification, and neutron spectrum. With regard to core configuration, two annular cores are investigated in terms of the neutron economy. A conventional radial shuffling scheme of fuel blocks is compared with an axial-only block-shuffling strategy in terms of the fuel burnup and core power distributions. The impact of the kernel size of the {TRISO} fuel is evaluated, and a diluted kernel, instead of a conventional concentrated kernel, is introduced to maximize the {TRU} burnup by reducing the self-shielding effects of the {TRISO} particles. A higher graphite density is also evaluated in terms of the fuel burnup. In addition, it is shown that the core power distribution can be effectively controlled by a zoning of the packing fraction of the {TRISO} fuels. We also have shown that a long-cycle {DB}-{MHR} core can be designed by using a two- or three-batch fuel-reloading scheme, at the expense of only a marginal decrease of the {TRU} discharge burnup. Finally, preliminary safety characteristics of a {DB}-{MHR} core have been investigated in terms of the temperature coefficients and effective delayed neutron fraction. It has been found that, depending on the fuel management scheme and fuel specifications, the {TRU} burnup in an optimized {DB}-{MHR} core can be well over 60\% in a single-pass irradiation campaign.},

	abstract = {Axial coolant flow inside a tightly packed rod bundle presents a complex behavior; experimental analysis had clearly shown that when reducing the pitch-to-diameter ratio (P/D) the turbulence field in rod bundles deviates significantly from that in a circular tube. Moreover for extremely tight configurations the existence of large-scale periodic “flow oscillations” has been shown, which is responsible for the high inter-sub-channel heat and momentum exchange. A complete understanding of these oscillations has still to be achieved; the evidence shown to this point suggests that the oscillations are connected to interactions between coherent structures in adjacent sub-channels. Moreover, the coherent structures show a truly three-dimensional pattern (i.e., structures in different gaps tend to interact) that has not been fully investigated up to this point. A fully transient simulation of turbulence has been performed for an infinite tight triangular lattice. In this case it has been performed with Large Eddy Simulation ({LES}) at Re=6400 and P/D=1.05. A database of snapshots of the flow field has then been collected and proper orthogonal decomposition ({POD}), a powerful statistical technique, has been applied in order to obtain the most energetic modes of turbulence. The results obtained highlight the presence of several travelling waves propagating in the streamwise direction. The spatial modulation of the travelling waves offers a phenomenological explanation for observed de-coherence effects between the velocity signal in different gaps. It also provides additional insight into the three dimensional structure of the flow oscillations.},

	volume = {5},
	doi = {10.1115/ICONE20-POWER2012-54521},
	abstract = {In the last years, increasing interest has been focused on an innovative concept of Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) characterized by a fast neutron spectrum that combines the favorable characteristics of {MSRs} adopting molten salt fluorides both as fuel and coolant with those ones of fast neutron reactors. As a matter of fact, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fuelled fast neutron systems and has been identified as reference Gen-{IV} configuration. Although considerable studies have been carried out for the analysis of the graphite-moderated {MSR} dynamics, the adoption of a fast spectrum configuration without graphite in the core is expected to notably modify the dynamic behavior of the system, thus requiring further investigation. In this paper, a preliminary analysis of the {MSFR} dynamics is performed allowing for the evaluation of the impact of some safety parameters (e.g., feedback coefficients and delayed neutron fraction) on the system behavior for different fuel cycle strategies. For this purpose, a simplified non-linear one-dimensional model of the primary circuit has been developed and the dynamic response of the system has been investigated with reference to different significant transient initiators, namely: unprotected transient overpower, unprotected loss of flow, and unprotected loss of heat sink. These analyses are thought to give a basic understanding of the {MSFR} dynamics, as well as significant indications in terms of the system safety parameters.},

	abstract = {In pyroprocessing it is important to determine the amount of Pu in the various streams of materials involved. This paper presents two approaches to determine the Pu mass of spent fuel assemblies using nondestructive assay and burnup simulation code. Cm balance is adopted and the concept of “Cm ratio,” the mass ratio of Pu to Cm, is used for the nuclear material accountancy for the model pyroprocessing facility. The biggest error of the nuclear material accountancy is expected to arise from the determination of Pu mass and Cm ratio in input homogeneously mixed uranium oxide powder, which is assayed nondestructively. One approach to determine the Pu mass and Cm ratio is to apply the average burnup of spent fuel and determine the Pu mass and Cm ratio by using the {ORIGEN} code. The estimated error in Pu mass determined by this method ranges from 0.94\% to 2.33\% for a total of 225 spent fuel assemblies of various burnup, initial enrichment, and cooling time. The other approach is to use the functional relationship between the neutron emission rate and Pu mass of spent fuel. The error in Pu mass calculated using this method ranges from -1.68\% to 3.86\%.},

The variation of solar incidence angle and the amount of solar energy received are analyzed for a number of fixed and tracking surfaces. The environment in which a solar system works depends mostly on the solar energy availability. For most solar energy applications, one needs reasonably accurate predictions of where the sun will be in the sky at a given time of day and year. In the Ptolemaic sense, the sun is constrained to move with 2 degrees of freedom on the celestial sphere; therefore, its position with respect to an observer on earth can be fully described by means of two astronomical angles, the solar altitude and the solar azimuth. An approximate method for calculating these angles is by means of sun-path diagrams. Also general weather of a location is required in many energy calculations. This can be presented as a typical meteorological year ({TMY}) file.},

The problem is discretized through spectral collocation and the eigenvalue problem has been solved with the Arnoldi-method based algorithms and the {QZ} algorithm. Since no numerical studies of this type have yet been performed to address the issue of transition in this geometry, the codes have been validated toward results obtained in simplified geometries (e.g., concentric annular channel and square channel). The eigenvalue spectra of the Poiseuille flow in eccentric channels and a U-shaped channel have then been computed and analyzed for a wide range of geometric parameter...},

	abstract = {Eccentric annular pipe flows represent an ideal model for investigating inhomogeneous turbulent shear flows, where conditions of turbulence production and transport vary significantly within the cross-section. Moreover recent works have proven that in geometries characterized by the presence of a narrow gap, large-scale coherent structures are present. The eccentric annular channel represents, in the opinion of the present authors, the prototype of these geometries. The aim of the present work is to verify the capability of a numerical methodology to fully reproduce the main features of the flow field in this geometry, to verify and characterize the presence of large-scale coherent structures, to examine their behavior at different Reynolds numbers and eccentricities and to analyze the anisotropy associated to these structures. The numerical approach is based upon {LES}, boundary fitted coordinates and a fractional step algorithm. A dynamic Sub Grid Scale ({SGS}) model suited for this numerical environment has been implemented and tested. An additional interest of this work is therefore in the approach employed itself, considering it as a step into the development of an effective {LES} methodology for flows in complex channel geometries. Agreement with previous experimental and {DNS} results has been found good overall for the streamwise velocity, shear stress and the rms of the velocity components. The instantaneous flow field presented large-scale coherent structures in the streamwise direction at low Reynolds numbers, while these are absent or less dominant at higher Reynolds and low eccentricity. After Reynolds averaging is performed over a long integration time the existence of secondary flows in the cross session is proven. Their shape is found to be constant over the Reynolds range surveyed, and dependent on the geometric parameters. The effect of secondary flows on anisotropy is studied over an extensive Reynolds range through invariant analysis. Additional insight on the mechanics of turbulence in this geometry is obtained.},

	abstract = {The Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) has garnered much interest for its inherent safety and sustainbility features. The {MSFR} can adopt a closed thorium fuel cycle for sustainable operation through the breeding of 233 U from 232 Th. The fuel composition changes significantly over the course of its lifespan. In this study, we investigated the steady state and transient behavior of the {MSFR} using Moltres, a coupled neutronics/thermal-hydraulics code developed within the Multiphysics Object Oriented Simulation Environment ({MOOSE}) framework. Three different fuel compositions, start-up, early-life, and equilibrium, were examined for potentially dangerous core temperature excursions during a unprotected loss of heat sink ({ULOHS}) accident. The six-group and total neutron flux distributions showed good agreement with {SERPENT} and published {MSFR} results, while the temperature distribution and total power showed discrepancies which can be attributed toknown sources of error. For the transient behavior under the {ULOHS} scenario, while the transition time towards the new steady state core temperature is also in good agreement with existing {MSFR} simulations by Fiorina et al., Moltres under-estimated the temperature rise by a factor of ten, due to the same sources of error affecting the steady state results. While an {MSFR} loaded with start-up fuel composition operates at a higher temperature than with the other two fuel compositions, all three cases were shown to be inherently safe due to thestrong negative temperature feedback.},

Dakota is a software tool developed at Sandia National Laboratories containing optimization, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantiﬁcation algorithms. Reliability methods are algorithms which transform the uncertainty problem to an optimization problem to solve for the failure probability, given uncertainty on problem inputs and a failure threshold on an output response. The goal of this work is to demonstrate the use of reliability methods in Dakota with {RAVEN}/{RELAP}-7. These capabilities are demonstrated on a demonstration of a Station Blackout analysis of a simpliﬁed Pressurized Water Reactor ({PWR}).},

To better understand the potential safety margins in {mHTGR} design basis accidents, we performed thermal-hydraulics sensitivity studies to investigate how maximum fuel temperature varies considering various parameters, e.g. thermal properties, within the ranges corresponding to the differences between the {FCM}-fueled prismatic {mHTGR} cores and the reference core with conventional fuel compacts. We found that the difference in the steady-state axial power distribution contributed the most to the difference in the maximum fuel temperature, in both normal operation and design basis accidents.},

	abstract = {The recent interest in advanced fuel forms that offer increased thermal conductivity and uranium density, as well as modifications (e.g., use of dopants or additives) to traditional {UO}2 fuel, necessitates a vehicle for performing high-throughput irradiation testing of these fuels before they can be safely deployed. This interest, combined with the recent decommissioning of the Halden Reactor, places a strong burden on the remaining test reactors to provide the scientific data needed to advance these fuels toward commercialization. Oak Ridge National Laboratory is actively working to alleviate some of this burden by commissioning a new “{MiniFuel}” test facility that will provide a vehicle for performing accelerated separate-effects irradiation testing of subsized nuclear fuel specimens. The small size of the fuel allows for a flexible irradiation vehicle capable of exploring a wide range of fuel performance variables within a reasonable time and cost. This paper describes the experiment facility and the initial irradiation experiments being performed, including uranium nitride ({UN}) kernels, coated tristructural-isotropic {UN} particles, doped and undoped (for reference) {UO}2 disks, U3Si2 disks, and fully ceramic microencapsulated ({FCM}) pellets with {UN} kernels and a {SiC} matrix.},

	abstract = {Cylindrical wire wrapped fuel pins are the primary design choice for the tightly packed fuel
array of the epithermal core option of the {IRIS} reactor. However it is desirable to
investigate alternative approaches to enhance thermal margins. Hence novel nuclear fuel
shapes have been studied for use as backup configurations in the {IRIS} reactor. The
performance of these shapes compared with cylindrical fuel pins has been assessed by
introduction of figures of merit (performance indices P/s and 77s) capable of relating
geometrical properties to key thermalhydraulic parameters such as core pressure drop,
critical heat flux, fuel centerline temperature, clad surface temperature and stress
distribution. The performance indices have been determined for various arrangements of
cylindrical, triangular, square and hexagonal fuel shapes. Among these fuel candidates,
the hexagonal fuel pins, both twisted and straight, proved to be the best backup solution
for adoption by {IRIS}. The advantages of the hexagonal shape versus the traditional
cylindrical shape with grid spacers are several. The twisted hex allows (a) a reduction of
the total pressure drop by 16\%, (b) an increase of the critical heat flux ratio margin by
200\%. The straight hex allows flatter subchannel velocity profile, wall shear stress and
wall temperature distributions. The latter result, that is due to a uniform subchannel
section width, has come from a {CFD} analysis carried out to confirm the results of the
performance parameter approach.},

The problem is deﬁned by three non-dimensional geometric design variables composed of dimpled channel height, dimple print diameter, dimple spacing, and dimple depth, to maximize heat transfer rate compromising with pressure drop. Twenty designs generated by Latin hypercube sampling were evaluated by Reynoldsaveraged Navier–Stokes solver and the evaluated objectives were used to construct Pareto optimal front through hybrid multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. The optimum designs were grouped by k-means clustering technique and some of the clustered points were evaluated by ﬂow analysis. With increase in dimple depth, heat transfer rate increases and at the same time pressure drop also increases, while opposite behavior is obtained for the dimple spacing. The heat transfer performance is related to the vertical motion of the ﬂow and the reattachment length in the dimple.},

	title = {Assessment of Helical-Cruciform Fuel Rods for High Power Density {LWRs}},
	abstract = {In order to significantly increase the power density of Light Water Reactors ({LWRs}), the helical-cruciform ({HC}) fuel rod assembly has been proposed as an alternative to traditional fuel geometry. The {HC} assembly is a self-supporting nuclear fuel configuration consisting of 4-finned, axially-twisted fuel rods closely packed against one another in a square array. Within the {LWR} core, {HC} fuel would in theory possess several inherent advantages over traditional fuel, potentially allowing for operation at a higher power density. Chief among these advantages are a larger surface-to-volume ratio, a shorter radial heat conduction path, and improved mixing characteristics. In previous work, computational models of the {HC} fuel assembly have been of limited accuracy due to the absence suitable correlations. To address needs within these subchannel analysis models, experimental measurements of rod bundle coolant mixing have been conducted with 4x4 arrays of {HC} test rods. The tests used the technique of a hot water tracer injection (at 95'C) into a bulk flow of cold water (at 25'C). Downstream temperature measurements were used to judge the rate of lateral cross-flow within the {HC} rod bundle. These tests were conducted at atmospheric pressure, and encompassed a range of mass fluxes from 1000 kg/m2s to 3500 kg/m 2s, {HC} rod twist pitches of 200cm, 100cm, and 50cm, and different hot water injection velocities and mixing lengths. Data from over 300 tests was analyzed, yielding a best fit correlation for use with any twist pitch, rod length, or coolant flow rate. Compared to the bare rod bundle, this correlation implies an enhancement in the intensity of turbulent interchange of 40\% brought about by the {HC} geometry, and a 1.6\% forced diversion of axial flow per subchannel, per quarter-turn along the rod length. These parameters fit all data points considered within a standard deviation of 24\%. Stochastic error was limited to ±16\%by the use of precise temperature sensors.},

The flow is unstable to two of the four possible modes of different parity and stable to the other two. With respect to the most unstable mode, the flow is stable or unstable according as the aspect ratio is below or above a critical value of 3.2 respectively, and the critical Reynolds number decreases monotonically with increasing aspect ratio towards the known value of 5772 for plane Poiseuille flow. The flow field of the disturbance shows the existence of strong vortex layers along the critical layer at which the velocity equals the phase velocity of the disturbance.},

A natural question in this context is what will be the .transformation pathway. towards stabilization; that is, how do we get from here to there? The topic of this chapter is transformation pathways. The chapter is primarily motivated by three questions. First, what are the near-term and future choices that define transformation pathways, including the goal itself, the emissions pathway to the goal, technologies used for and sectors contributing to mitigation, the nature of international coordination, and mitigation policies? Second, what are the key characteristics of different transformation pathways, including the rates of emissions reductions and deployment of low-carbon energy, the magnitude and timing of aggregate economic costs, and the implications for other policy objectives such as those generally associated with sustainable development? Third, how will actions taken today influence the options that might be available in the future? As part of the assessment in this chapter, data from over 1000 new scenarios published since the {IPCC} Fourth Assessment Report ({AR}4) were collected from integrated modelling research groups, many from large-scale model intercomparison studies. In comparison to {AR}4, new scenarios, both in this {AR}5 dataset and more broadly in the literature assessed in this chapter, consider more ambitious concentration goals, a wider range of assumptions about technology, and more possibilities for delays in additional global mitigation beyond that of today and fragmented international action.},

	abstract = {Geometries containing a narrow gap are characterized by strong quasi-periodical flow oscillations in the narrow gap region. The above mentioned phenomena are of inherently unstable nature and, even if no conclusive theoretical study on the subject has been published, the evidence shown to this point suggests that the oscillations are connected to interactions between eddy structures of turbulent flows on opposite sides of the gap. These coherent structures travel in the direction of homogeneous turbulence, in a fashion that strongly recalls a vortex street. Analogous behaviours have been observed for arrays of arbitrarily shaped channels, within certain range of the geometric parameters. A modelling for these phenomena is at least problematic to achieve since they are turbulence driven. This work aims to address the use of Proper Orthogonal Decomposition ({POD}) to reduce the Navier–Stokes equations to a set of ordinary differential equations and better understand the dynamics underlying these oscillations. Both experimental and numerical data are used to carry out the {POD}.},

	abstract = {The complex geometry of the hexagonal fuel blocks of the prismatic fuel assembly in a very high temperature reactor ({VHTR}) hinders accurate evaluations of the temperature proﬁle within the fuel assembly without elaborate numerical calculations. Therefore, simpliﬁed models such as a unit cell model have been widely applied for the analyses and designs of prismatic {VHTRs} since they have been considered as effective approaches reducing the computational efforts. In a prismatic {VHTR}, however, the simpliﬁed models cannot consider a heat transfer within a fuel assembly as well as a coolant ﬂow through a bypass gap between the fuel assemblies, which may signiﬁcantly affect the maximum fuel temperature. In this paper, a three-dimensional computational ﬂuid dynamics ({CFD}) analysis has been carried out on a typical fuel assembly of a prismatic {VHTR}. Thermal behaviours and heat transfer within the fuel assembly are intensively investigated using the {CFD} solutions. In addition, the accuracy of the unit cell approach is assessed against the {CFD} solutions. Two example situations are illustrated to demonstrate the deﬁciency of the unit cell model caused by neglecting the effects of the bypass gap ﬂow and the radial power distribution within the fuel assembly.},

The high temperature results in thermal stress with dimensional changes in addition to the mechanical stress caused by the external loads.

In the present study, a ﬁnite element analysis ({FEA}) of each fuel element in a 10-story fuel assembly was carried out by using the temperature distribution which was calculated from a previous study of computational ﬂuid dynamics ({CFD}) analysis on the fuel assembly. The results showed that the maximum stress level in the fuel elements reaches 32\% of the tensile strength. The maximum stress point was at the circumference of the bottom surface of a graphite plug on which the thermal expansion of the fuel compacts pushes up the graphite plug. Mitigation of the maximum stress by placing a small gap between the graphite plug and the fuel compact was investigated and the effect of the gap was conﬁrmed. Stress evaluation was performed according to a draft of standard for nuclear graphite. All stress components lied within the limits and the structural integrity was regarded to be attained.},

Not surprisingly, the number of degrees of freedom for simulations keptpace with the increasing computing power. But when it comes to optimal design or control the problems are in general to large to be tackled with standard techniques. Hence, there is a strong need for model reduction techniques to reduce the computational costs and storage requirements. They should yield low–dimensional approximations for the full high–dimensional dynamical system, which reproduce the characteristic dynamics of the system.},

	abstract = {This work presents two different methods for quantifying and propagating the uncertainty associated with fuel composition at end of life for cask criticality calculations. The first approach, the computational approach uses parametric uncertainty including those associated with nuclear data, fuel geometry, material composition, and plant operation to perform forward depletion on Monte-Carlo sampled inputs. These uncertainties are based on experimental and prior experience in criticality safety. The second approach, the data-driven approach relies on using radiochemcial assay data to derive code bias information. The code bias data is used to perturb the isotopic inventory in the data-driven approach. For both approaches, the uncertainty in keff for the cask is propagated by performing forward criticality calculations on sampled inputs using the distributions obtained from each approach. It is found that the data driven approach yielded a higher uncertainty than the computational approach by about 500 pcm. An exploration is also done to see if considering correlation between isotopes at end of life affects keff uncertainty, and the results demonstrate an effect of about 100 pcm.},

Development of innovative chemical reactors is in progress, which are equipped with a ceramic heat exchanger.

This work adopted the {SERPENT}-2 Monte Carlo code to analyze the whole core model of the {SD}-{TMSR}. Built-in {SERPENT}-2 capabilities simulated online reprocessing and refueling and calculated the multiplication factor and Breeding Ratio ({BR}). We found that the molten salt Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity (αT) was negative for initial and equilibrium states. This study investigated the variation of the multiplication factor, {BR}, and build-up of important nuclides in the core as a function of burnup. Under online reprocessing and refueling, we studied the variation of the reactivity during 60 years of reactor operation. Additionally, the neutron spectrum shift during the reactor operation was calculated. Finally, these simulations determined the appropriate 232Th and 233U feed rates for maintaining criticality and enabled analysis of the overall {SD}-{TMSR} fuel cycle performance.},

The steady state models solve the multi-group diffusion k-eigenvalue equations with moving precursors together with the energy equation. A fixed velocity field is assumed throughout the computations, hence the momentum and continuity equations are not solved.

It has been pointed out that the poor capacity of interregional transmission lines that interconnect the power grids of the regional monopoly utilities hinders wind power from being substantially exploited. This study evaluated the wind power integration potential in Japan with assumptions that the ramping-up (ramping-down) capability in regular operation of an individual utility equals the largest hourly increment (decrement) of electric demand and that totaling each regional ramping capability yields a nationwide capability by strengthening the interregional transmission lines so that the whole of Japan can be regarded as a single system without any bottlenecks at regional boundaries. On the other hand, the potential by implementing a wind power curtailment measure was also evaluated.},

	abstract = {In this study we develop and apply new methods of data analysis for high resolution wind power and system load time series, to improve our understanding of how to characterize highly variable wind power output and the correlations between wind power and load. These methods are applied to wind and load data from the {ERCOT} region, and wind power output from the {PJM} and {NYISO} areas. We use a wavelet transform to apply mathematically well-defined operations of smoothing and differencing to the time series data. This approach produces a set of time series of the changes in wind power and load (or “deltas”), over a range of times scales from a few seconds to approximately one hour. A number of statistical measures of these time series are calculated. We present sample distributions, and devise a method for fitting the empirical distribution shape in the tails. We also evaluate the degree of serial correlation, and linear correlation between wind and load. Our examination of the data shows clearly that the deltas do not follow a Gaussian shape; the distribution is exponential near the center and appears to follow a power law for larger fluctuations. Gaussian distributions are frequently used in modeling studies. These are likely to over-estimate the probability of small to moderate deviations. This in turn may lead to an over-estimation of the additional reserve requirement (hence the cost) for high penetration of wind. The Gaussian assumption provides no meaningful information about the real likelihood of large fluctuations. The possibility of a power law distribution is interesting because it suggests that the distribution shape for of wind power fluctuations may become independent of system size for large enough systems.},

The Pu quality ratio variation is found to be due to the differences in axial neutron flux and neutron interaction cross-sections of U and Pu isotopes. The Pu axial non-uniformity is found to be larger for isotopes with smaller neutron cross-sections. Analysis shows initially, the axial neutron flux distribution dictated the Pu-239 concentration. When the fuel irradiation time increased, the ratio of U-238 neutron capture to Pu-239 neutron absorption cross-section is found to influence the Pu-239 concentration. A fuel rod concept with a varied axial uranium enrichment is modeled and simulated to understand the non-uniformity of Pu quality ratio. The results show that not only the peaks for Pu quality ratio reduced at the top (3.63\%) and bottom (4.62\%) of the assembly but also a maximum reduction of 6.25\% in non-uniformity is obtained.},

	abstract = {The optimization of a Sodium-cooled Fast Reactor ({SFR}) core is a challenging process, due to the large number of design parameters, the nonlinearities among inputs and outputs, and the complicated correlation among output parameters. This study attempts to develop a generalized framework for the {SFR} core optimization by coupling the sensitivity analysis, advanced optimization algorithm, and optionally the surrogate modeling. The framework is built based on the fast reactor modeling capability of the Argonne Reactor Computation ({ARC}) suite and the sensitivity analysis and optimization modules embedded in the {DAKOTA} code, both have been integrated within the {NEAMS} Workbench. The genetic algorithm is selected as the optimization method for its robustness, while the option of surrogate modeling is also explored to alleviate the computational burden caused by employing the {ARC} direct core physics simulation and thus enhance the efficiency of the optimization. Finally, the normalized deviations of performance parameters of the near-optimal solution from those of the ideal core are calculated and used as criteria to down select the final core design. The developed framework is applied to the Advanced Burner Test Reactor ({ABTR}) core, and optimal solutions are determined by balancing various objectives simultaneously, including peak fast flux, core volume, power, reactivity swing, plutonium mass feed, while at the same time satisfying the predefined constraints due to safety or economics considerations. The optimal {ABTR} core design obtained using the direct physical simulation and surrogated model are compared and discussed. It is found that using the accurately constructed surrogate models can significantly reduce the required computational time while maintaining satisfactory accuracy.},

Still, much remains to be explored before the capabilities of these methods are well understood. In this paper, we present the first application of {DRL} to direct shape optimization. We show that, given adequate reward, an artificial neural network trained through {DRL} is able to generate optimal shapes on its own, without any prior knowledge and in a constrained time. While we choose here to apply this methodology to aerodynamics, the optimization process itself is agnostic to details of the use case, and thus our work paves the way to new generic shape optimization strategies both in fluid mechanics, and more generally in any domain where a relevant reward function can be defined.},

The heat is transported by conduction in the solid part of the domain and by conduction, convection and radiative transfer in the ﬂuid part (the cylinders). A non-local boundary condition models the radiative heat transfer on the cylinder walls. To obtain the homogenized problem we ﬁrst use a formal two-scale asymptotic expansion method. The resulting eﬀective model is a convectiondiﬀusion equation posed in a homogeneous domain with homogenized coeﬃcients evaluated by solving so-called cell problems where radiative transfer is taken into account. In a second step we rigorously justify the homogenization process by using the notion of two-scale convergence. One feature of this work is that it combines homogenization with a 3D to 2D asymptotic analysis since the radiative transfer in the limit cell problem is purely two-dimensional. Eventually, we provide some 3D numerical results in order to show the convergence and the computational advantages of our homogenization method.},

While such high 7Li enrichment would undoubtedly bring great technical challenges and high costs to the molten salt preparation. Meanwhile, the 6Li neutron absorption cross section differs greatly under different neutron spectra, which would probably mean the choice of 7Li enrichment can be different for the molten salt reactors with different neutron spectra. With the aim to provide an appropriate reference for the choice of 7Li enrichment in the engineering design of molten salt reactors, key parameters (including 233U inventory, neutron spectrum, temperature coefficient, 7Li enrichment, 7Li and 6Li neutron absorption rate, breeding ratio, relative 233U production and doubling time) and their time evolution are systematically explored based on the in-house developed code {MSR}-{RS}. The results show that 99.99\% and 99.95\% in 7Li enrichment introduce limited influence on Th-U breeding performance for a thermal and fast reactor respectively, and their temperature coefficient are negative. By trading off the cost and technologies required for enriching 7Li, the above two 7Li enrichment are therefore recommended.},

	title = {Material Diversion Analysis Within a Fuel Cycle Simulator},
	abstract = {The {IAEA} considers a State’s entire fuel cycle capability when evaluating and implementing safeguards, a process known as the State-Level Approach. Conducting Acquisition Path Analysis ({APA}) is one aspect of ensuring efficient use of safeguards resources and an objective evaluation of member States. {APA} is designed to identify, characterize, and rank technically-feasible pathways through a fuel cycle to produce weapons-usable material. The focus of previous {APA} tools has been identifying diversion pathways. However, the ability to analyze pathways for material throughput capacity is crucial in estimating pathway completion times and implementing tailored safeguards. Fuel cycle simulators can be used to generate and study acquisition pathways with more detail by tracking material flows. The Cyclus fuel cycle simulator inherently represents the flows of material among facilities as a graph that can be traversed to identify the numerous acquisition pathways. This work adds material balance areas to Cyclus facilities such that a richer set of acquisition path steps can be studied. Cyclus facility archetypes implement material buffers for holding material objects internally, but flows between these buffers are internal to the archetype. A mechanism is introduced to expose the flows between these internal buffers in a way that extends the full system flow graph. A simplified case will be used to generate all possible diversion pathways and their material throughput capacity. A similar fuel cycle with a single clandestine facility will also be simulated to demonstrate how the presence of a clandestine facility expands the acquisition paths available to a diverting State.},

	abstract = {The electricity market in the U.S. is moving toward an energy mix including more variable renewable energy ({VRE}) sources like wind and solar. This increasing {VRE} penetration is altering the profile of the net electricity demand. Traditionally, flexible generators (e.g. gas turbines) are used to absorb fluctuations in the electricity demand. Therefore, an increase in {VRE} also leads to an increase in installed capacity for such flexible generators which, in turn, may increase the price of electricity. Nuclear-Renewable Hybrid Energy Systems (N-R {HES}) are seen as a solution to this problem. The N-R {HES} contains a nuclear power plant electrically and/or thermally linked to an industrial process ({IP}). This paper demonstrates a new methodology and presents the corresponding {RAVEN}/Modelica-based software framework to evaluate the financial performance of N-R {HES}. The novelty of the method is that it explicitly incorporates the stochastic nature of N-R {HES} inputs such as electricity demand and wind speeds. The method is applied to a generic (rather than region-specific) N-R {HES}. The analysis shows that under the right market conditions, economic benefits can be achieved by adding a suitable {IP} to the base-load generator. In particular, there exists an optimal relationship between the {IP} capacity and the demand. Global trends also indicate {VRE} penetration raises the cost of electricity due to the added volatility, an issue only mitigated when operating with high profit margins for the {IP}.},

	title = {Sensitivity Analysis of Nuclear Fuel Cycle Transitions},
	rights = {Copyright 2019 Gwendolyn Jin Yi Chee},
	abstract = {The present United States nuclear fuel cycle faces challenges that hinder the expansion of nuclear energy technology. The U.S. Department of Energy identi ed four classes of nuclear fuel cycle options the U.S could transition to, which would overcome these challenges and make nuclear energy technology more desirable. The transitions have been modeled by various nuclear fuel cycle simulators. However, most fuel cycle simulators require the user to define a deployment
scheme for all supporting facilities to avoid any supply chain gaps, which becomes tedious for complex transition scenarios. This thesis developed a capability in Cyclus, a nuclear fuel cycle
simulator, to automatically deploy fuel cycle facilities to meet user-defined power demand. This new capability successfully deployed fuel cycle facilities in a transition scenario from the current light water reactor fleet to a closed fuel cycle with continuous recycling of transuranics in fast and thermal reactors. In reality, these transition scenarios inevitably diverge from the modeled scenario. This work coupled the nuclear fuel cycle simulator tools, Cyclus and {DYMOND}, with Dakota, a
sensitivity analysis toolkit. This work conducted one-at-a-time, synergistic, and global sensitivity analysis with Cyclus-Dakota and {DYMOND}-Dakota, to understand the interdependence of input
parameters on the transition performance from the current light water reactor 
eet to a closed fuel cycle in which transuranics are recycled to fuel mixed oxide fuel thermal reactors and sodium fast-cooled reactors. The global sensitivity analysis concluded that the transition year input parameter was the most influential to the final depleted uranium and total idle reactor capacity performance
metrics, and the fleet share ratio and cooling time input parameters were the most influential to the final high level waste amount in the simulation. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis showed
that varying transition year from 80 to 84 years increased the final depleted uranium amount by 1.13\% and reduced the total idle reactor capacity by 10.36\%. The one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis also showed that varying fleet share ratio (mixed oxide fuel light water reactor: sodium fast-cooled reactor) from 0:100 to 20:80 reduced the final high level waste amount by 2\%, and varying the used fuel cooling time from 0 to 8 years reduced the final high level waste amount by 4\%. Therefore, an optimized transition scenario that minimizes final high level waste amount, final depleted uranium amount, and total idle capacity must have a fleet share ratio of 20:80, used fuel cooling time of 8
years, and a transition year at 83 years. This work compared Cyclus-Dakota's and {DYMOND}-Dakota's sensitivity analysis capabilities and concluded that automated deployment of supporting fuel cycle facilities is crucial for conducting sensitivity analyses with nuclear fuel cycle simulators, to ensure that the simulation adapts to the new parameters by minimizing idle reactor capacity.
The results demonstrated that time is saved if a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of a nuclear fuel cycle transition scenario begins with a global sensitivity analysis study to gain a general overview of the influential input variables for the performance metrics. Then, based on the global sensitivity analysis results, a reduced number of one-at-a-time and synergistic sensitivity analyses are conducted to determine quantitative trends and impacts of influential input variables on the performance metrics.},

	title = {Modeling Special Nuclear Material Diversion from a Pyroprocessing Facility},
	rights = {Copyright 2019 Greg Westphal},
	abstract = {As a result of the once-through fuel cycle implemented in the {US}, used nuclear fuel ({UNF})
steadily increases. One proposed solution is the transition to a closed nuclear fuel cycle, in
which reprocessing reduces build up of {UNF}. Pyroprocessing is an attractive method for this
transition for its capabilities separating both light water reactor ({LWR}) and metallic fuels,
and inherent proliferation resistance. However, unlike aqueous reprocessing plants, industrial pyroprocessing plants do not yet exist. Similar to safety-by-design in next-generation
reactors, reprocessing facilities could be designed with safeguards in mind via safeguardsby-design. Without operational experience, these safeguards-by-design need to be derived
through modeling and simulation.
This thesis develops a medium fidelity generic model, Pyre, capable of simulating a variety
of pyroprocessing facility configurations. Pyre also simulates diversion via a diverter class
capable of tracking signatures and observables. Rather than only tracking exact material
production, we use signatures and observables such as operating temperature, pressure, and
current to mimic the capabilities of International Atomic Energy Agency ({IAEA}) inspections
and aid identification of nefarious fuel cycles, or shadow fuel cycles.
These capabilities are verified in a transition scenario of the current {US} fuel cycle to a
sodium fast reactor ({SFR}) based closed fuel cycle. Key operating parameters are determined
through sensitivity analysis of this scenario, monitoring isotopic changes in material unaccounted for. This work concludes that facility parameters which increase interaction between
the salt and waste have more impact on material unaccounted for ({MUF}). This work also
expands the state of the art by exploring the use of sub-facility modeling to increase fuel
cycle fidelity.},

A separate driver program is written to run the coupled calculation including exchange of data, monitoring and determination of convergence. Data provided by the fuel performance code includes the radial temperature distribution and the radius changes in the axial slices of a fuel pin while the reactor physics code provides the linear power and fast neutron flux along with the form of the radial power density in the corresponding axial slices of the pin. The coupling is demonstrated in a calculation case based on a fuel performance benchmark for a burnable absorber rod with gadolinium.

	abstract = {This paper documents the models available in Serpent for high temperature reactor ({HTR}) calculations. It is supplemented by a calculation example of {ASTRA} critical pebble bed experiments. In the pebble bed reactor modeling, different methods have been used to model the double heterogeneity problem occurring in pebble bed reactor calculations. A solution was sought to avoid unphysical simpliﬁcations in the pebble bed modeling and the stochastic geometry modeling features available in the Monte Carlo code Serpent were applied for exact placement of pebbles and fuel particles. Randomly packed pebble beds were produced in discrete element method ({DEM}) simulations and fuel particles were positioned randomly inside the pebbles. Pebbles and particles are located using a Cartesian search mesh, which provides necessary computational efﬁciency. Serpent uses Woodcock delta-tracking which provides efﬁcient neutron tracking in the complicated geometries. This detailed pebble bed modeling approach was tested by calculating the {ASTRA} criticality benchmark experiment done at the Kurchatov Institute in 2004. The calculation results are in line with the sample calculations provided with the benchmark documentation. The material library selected for the calculations has a major effect on the results. The difference in graphite absorption cross section is considered the cause of this result. The model added in Serpent is very efﬁcient with a calculation time slightly higher than with a regular lattice approximation. It is demonstrated that Serpent can be used for pebble bed reactor calculations with minimal geometric approximations as it allows exact pebble bed modeling with randomly positioned fuel particles and locations of pebbles produced by {DEM}. Due to the added stochastic geometry features and efﬁcient neutron tracking, it is concluded that Serpent is well suited for the calculations of {HTRs}.},

The coupled code is used to simulate a single axial section of a {BWR} mini assembly with a spacer grid. The mini assembly is analyzed at two different inlet conditions, nominal {BWR} inlet conditions, and 15\% void. The coupled calculation gave detailed results for both of these cases. The effect of various spacer grid modeling assumptions was also analyzed. Homogenizing the spacer grid into the coolant at the location of the spacer grid is found to give similar results as modeling the spacer grid explicitly.},

	abstract = {System analysis codes have a long history of providing best-estimate and conservative safety analysis for both light water and advanced reactor technologies, including molten salt reactors. As interest continues to expand with advanced reactor concepts, system analysis codes will need revisions to accommodate the behavior of these technologies. Legacy system analysis codes will need to be updated to the latest numerical techniques to shorten execution time and increase the accuracy of results. One example of a modern system analysis code that already encompasses these characteristics is the System Analysis Module ({SAM}). One key objective of this paper was to review available information for system code modeling of the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment ({MSRE}) from sources in the open literature and collect the information from these open sources in one place for the first time. This supports the potential objective of developing an open specification for system code analysis for {MSRE} steady state and transients with and without reactor kinetics. Data from actual {MSRE} tests will serve as the basis for code-to-code comparison exercises, including the {MSRE} zero power physics tests, the fuel pump start-up and coast down tests, and the natural circulation transient. The objective is to produce a code-to-code benchmark with a standardized set of comparison problems, recognizing the limitations of the original data. To demonstrate an initial application of this objective and the usefulness of compiling this open data, two Molten Salt Reactor Experiment ({MSRE})-related models were developed to evaluate {SAM} for liquid fueled molten salt reactors. One model was the {SAM} {MSRE} hydraulic mockup, which provided experimental data for pressure drop measurements. The second model was the complete {MSRE} primary loop. The {MSRE} primary loop model incorporated a fluoride salt fuel/coolant with heat transfer in both the core and heat exchanger. For both the hydraulic mockup and {MSRE} primary loop models, a holistic 1-D system description was built using open documentation, an open description that can be readily modified and applied for any system analysis code. {SAM} results for the pressure drop of the hydraulic mockup model were within 6\% with measurements. Coolant temperatures for the primary loop model matched the expected axial change in temperature from historical calculations. Using alternative coolant properties obtained from the literature, corresponding to salts with different actinide contents, returned similar trends in core temperature profiles. A thermal hydraulic demonstration of a loss-of-flow transient showed the importance of coupling {SAM} thermal hydraulic analysis to neutronics. This coupling is essential for simulating {MSR} transients with system analysis codes.},

	abstract = {Current radioisotope identification devices struggle to identify and quantify isotopes in low-resolution gamma-ray spectra in a wide range of realistic conditions. Trained gamma-ray spectroscopists typically rely on intuition when identifying isotopes in spectra. A trained gamma-ray spectroscopist can inject their intuition into pattern recognition algorithms by creating training datasets and intelligently choosing a machine learning model for a task. Algorithms based on feature extraction such as peak finding or {ROI} algorithms work well for well-calibrated high resolution detectors. For low-resolution detectors, it may be more beneficial to use algorithms that incorporate more abstract features of the spectrum. To investigate this, we simulated datasets and used them to train artificial neural networks ({ANNs}) for identification and quantification tasks using gamma-ray spectra. Because the datasets were simulated, this method can be extended to a variety of gamma-ray spectroscopy tasks. Models weinvestigated include dense, convolutional, and autoencoder {ANNs}. In this work we introduce annsa, an open source Python package capable of creating gamma-ray spectroscopy training datasets and applying machine learning models to solve spectroscopic tasks. Using annsa, we found that identification performance in simulated spectra was sensitive to the source-to-background ratio, detector gain setting, and shielding. Performance was less sensitive to the source-detector height and detector resolution. We demonstrate annsa’s capabilities on a source inter-
diction classification problem, outperforming a peak-based Bayesian classifier for source identification. We also demonstrate annsa on a uranium enrich-
ment quantification problem which shows an accuracy useful for homeland security applications.},

This quick, flexible, medium-fidelity method to estimate depleted {PWR} fuel assembly compositions is used to model scenarios in which the {PWR} fuel burnup and enrichment vary over time. The Used Nuclear Fuel Storage, Transportation \& Disposal Analysis Resource and Data System ({UNF}-{ST}\&{DARDS}) Unified Database ({UDB}) provided a ground truth on which the model trained. We validated the model by comparing the U.S. {UNF} inventory profile predicted by the model with the {UDB} {UNF} inventory profile. The neural network yields less than 1\% error for {UNF} inventory decay heat and activity and less than 2\% error for major isotopic inventory. The neural network model takes 0.27 s for 100 predictions, compared to 118 s for 100 Oak Ridge Isotope {GENeration} ({ORIGEN}) calculations. We also implemented this model into Cyclus, an agent-based Nuclear Fuel Cycle ({NFC}) simulator, to perform rapid, medium-fidelity {PWR} depletion calculations. This model also allows discharge of batches with assemblies of varying burnup. Since the original private data cannot be retrieved from the model, this trained model can provide open-source depletion capabilities to {NFC} simulators. We show that training an artificial neural network with a dataset from a complex fuel depletion model can provide rapid, medium-fidelity depletion capabilities to large-scale fuel cycle simulations.},

Specifically, a traditional topology optimization technique ({SIMP}) is confirmed to produce branching characteristics in optimal designs. The Space Colonization Algorithm, which can generate similar topological patterns, is selected for in-depth investigation. A genetic algorithm drives generation of design candidates, providing a highly diversified search of the target design space. Finally, several synthesized optimal designs for steady-state heat conduction, derived using the described algorithms, are compared using commercial finite element software.},

This can be overcome by the introduction of numerical simulations; many commerical software can be used eﬀectively. However this kind of problem often requires the interaction of various codes, then the acquisition of licenses could become unaﬀordable. So, focusing on ﬂuid dynamics, an open-source shape optimization framework is developed here, involving the combined use of {OpenFOAM}, Dakota and {MiMMO} library. The procedure is tested on a practical naval case, i.e. the optimization of the bulb’s shape. In particular the eﬀect of protrusion and immersion of this ship’s component is investigated through Surrogate Based Optimization. In addition benchmarks of the {OpenFOAM} numerical model and the eﬀect of sailing speed on the response surface are presented.},

	abstract = {A generative {CAD} based design exploration method is proposed. It is suitable for complex multicriteria design problems where important performance criteria are uncomputable. The method is based on building a genotype of the design within a history based parametric {CAD} system and then, varying its parameters randomly within pre-defined limits to generate a set of distinctive designs. The generated designs are then filtered through various constraint envelopes representing geometric viability, manufacturability, cost and other performance related constraints, thus reducing the vast design space into a smaller viable design space represented by a set of distinctive designs. These designs may then be further developed by the designer. The proposed generative design method makes minimal imposition on the designer’s work process and maintains both flexibility and fluidity that is required for creative design exploration. Its ability to work seamlessly with current {CAD} based design practices from early conceptual to detailed design is demonstrated. The design philosophy behind this generative method and the key steps involved in its implementation are presented with examples.},

The current combined use is illustrated through an example involving generation of a set of 20 interrelated roof trusses with seven unique spans initiated by a parametric model of a saddle shaped stadium roof in Custom Objects. The paper concludes with a discussion of the synergies between associative modeling and generative systems and identifies future extensions aimed to exploit these synergies towards integrated performance-based generative design tools.},

The proposed framework integrates topology optimization and generative models (e.g., generative adversarial networks ({GANs})) in an iterative manner to explore new design options, thus generating a large number of designs starting from limited previous design data. In addition, anomaly detection can evaluate the novelty of generated designs, thus helping designers choose among design options. The 2D wheel design problem is applied as a case study for validation of the proposed framework. The framework manifests better aesthetics, diversity, and robustness of generated designs than previous generative design methods.},

Combining a design generation tool with an analysis software and an evolutionary algorithm provides a methodology for optimising designs. This work combines {NASA}'s parametric aircraft design tool ({OpenVSP}) with a ﬂuid dynamics solver ({OpenFOAM}) to create and analyse aircraft. An evolutionary algorithm is then used to generate a range of aircraft that maximise lift and reduce drag while remaining within the framework of the original design. Our approach allows the designer to automatically optimise their chosen design and to generate models with improved aerodynamic efﬁciency. Different components on three aircraft models are varied to highlight the ease and effectiveness of the parametric model optimisation.},

	abstract = {In this paper we discuss the beneﬁts derived by combining parametric modeling and genetic algorithms to achieve a performance oriented process in design, with speciﬁc focus on architectural design. The key role played by geometry in architecture is discussed in relation to performance oriented design, in which evaluations based on engineering criteria are integrated into the conceptual phase of the design. The performance attained by a speciﬁc geometric solution is considered along with its complexity in an interdisciplinarity process. A speciﬁc case study using large roofs is presented as an example. Enabling the designer to automatically generate a large range of alternative design solutions is a great advantage offered by parametric modeling in supporting geometric design explorations. However, this in turn presents the difﬁculty of how to evaluate the resulting myriad of generated alternatives. {ParaGen} is presented as a tool to support the exploration of the parametric design alternatives. {ParaGen} combines parametric modeling, performance simulation software and genetic algorithms, together with a database to store and retrieve the solutions for subsequent exploration. The design exploration is enhanced by means of the interaction of the designer with the process. This serves two objectives. Firstly, it addresses the genetic algorithm based creation of design solutions, while still focusing on a given ﬁtness function. Secondly, it facilitates knowledge extraction from the generated solutions. A description of the tool and its possible uses by designers is provided. Applications of this tool are illustrated for both education and research, with speciﬁc reference to two examples in the ﬁeld of modular long span roofs. The ﬁrst case study has been developed as part of a teaching exercise in which {ParaGen} is used to explore the morphology of a dome based on structural performance. The second case study is derived from a research project which deals with solar energy transmission, and concerns the solar heat gain and daylight transmittance of a long span roof.},

	abstract = {In optimization, multiple objectives and constraints cannot be handled independently of the underlying optimizer. Requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface add yet another conﬂicting element to the decision process. While “better” solutions should be rated higher than “worse” ones, the resulting cost landscape must also comply with such requirements. Evolutionary algorithms ({EA}’s), which have found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, possess many characteristics desirable in a multiobjective optimizer, most notably the concerted handling of multiple candidate solutions. However, {EA}’s are essentially unconstrained search techniques which require the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or ﬁtness, to such candidate solutions. After reviewing current evolutionary approaches to multiobjective and constrained optimization, the paper proposes that ﬁtness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision making framework based on goals and priorities is subsequently formulated in terms of a relational operator, characterized, and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Finally, the ranking of an arbitrary number of candidates is considered. The effect of preference changes on the cost surface seen by an {EA} is illustrated graphically for a simple problem. The paper concludes with the formulation of a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the proposed decision strategy. Niche formation techniques are used to promote diversity among preferable candidates, and progressive articulation of preferences is shown to be possible as long as the genetic algorithm can recover from abrupt changes in the cost landscape.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of managing a nuclear reactor is how to design refuellings, and from
the 1980s to the present different artificial intelligence ({AI}) techniques have been applied to this
problem. A section of the reactor core resembles a symmetrical grid; long fuel assemblies are inserted
there, some of them new, some of them partly spent. Rods of “burnable poisons” dangle above, ready
to be inserted into the core, in order to stop the reactor. Traditionally, manual design was made
by shuffling positions in the grid heuristically, but {AI} enabled to automatically generate families of
candidate configurations, under safety constraints, as well as in order to optimize combustion, with
longer cycles of operation between shutdown periods, thus delaying the end-of-cycle point (except in
France, where shutdown is on an annual basis, and Canada, where individual fuel assemblies are
replaced, with no need for shutdown for rearranging the entire batch). Rule-based expert systems,
the first being {FUELCON}, were succeeded by projects combining neural and rule-based processing (a
symbolic-to-neural compilation of rules we did not implement), and later on, genetic algorithms in
{FUELGEN}. In the literature, one also comes across the application of fuzzy techniques, tabu search,
cellular automata and simulated annealing, as well as particle swarms. Safety regulations require
simulating the results using a parameter prediction tool; this is done using either nodal algorithms, or
neural processing.},

obtained for training the machine learning of the artificial neural network. This paper presents a feasibility study
on the automatic design of a research reactor core (a simplified core based on the Kyoto University Critical

core is developed by means of the artificial neural network and automatic machine learning. After setting a
design goal of the reactor core, the fuel assembly and core are designed by the proposed method and compared
with those designed by conventional design procedure. The results reveal that the reactor core designed by the

Variables in the model include those parameters that are usually determined at the conceptual design stage and that have critical inﬂuence on building performance. Life cycle analysis methodology is employed to evaluate design alternatives for both economical and environmental criteria. Life cycle environmental impacts are evaluated in terms of expanded cumulative exergy consumption, which is the sum of exergy consumption due to resource inputs and abatement exergy required to recover the negative impacts due to waste emissions. A multi-objective genetic algorithm is employed to ﬁnd optimal solutions.

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a virtual toolbox for the study of spatial–structural design processes. It will be able to transform a spatial design into a structural design. After structural optimisation, the structural design is interpreted as a spatial design. This spatial design is then modiﬁed to comply with the initial design requirements after which a new cycle starts. The transformation and optimisation processes within the toolbox can be altered, allowing automated design studies to be carried out. In this article, two processes for the structural optimisation are investigated to determine which is most suitable for speciﬁc conditions. These two processes are: (a) Topology Optimisation applied to complete structural systems for buildings; (b) Evolutionary Structural Optimisation for which only the ﬁrst step is used. It can be concluded that: (a) although Topology Optimisation is formally more correct, One-Step Evolutionary Structural Optimisation will yield almost the same qualitative results, (b) quantitatively the methods cannot be compared exactly, however, it is likely that Topology Optimisation results in more efﬁcient structures and (c) Topology Optimisation always leads to stable structures, whereas One-Step Evolutionary Structural Optimisation may yield a singular stiffness matrix, although this has no inﬂuence on the spatial design derived from the optimised structural design. It is intended to utilise the optimisation techniques in the virtual toolbox leading to design studies and to transcend additional transformation and optimisation processes in the virtual tool box via formal description. Fields of application are the academic study of spatial–structural design processes (i.e. design theory), the optimisation of all possible structural design types (i.e. design optimisation), and the generation of design instances (i.e. generative design).},

The first, a coevolutionary method, applies deterministic procedures, inspired by realistic design processes, to cyclically add a suitable structural design to the input of a spatial design, evaluate and improve the structural design via the finite element method and topology optimization, adjust the spatial design according to the improved structural design, and modify the spatial design such that the initial spatial requirements are fulfilled. The second method uses a genetic algorithm that works on a population of accompanying building spatial and structural designs, using the finite element method for evaluation. If specific performance indicators and spatial requirements are used (i.e., total strain energy, spatial volume, and number of spaces), both methods provide optimized building designs; however, the coevolutionary method yields even better designs in a faster and more direct manner, whereas the genetic algorithm based method provides more design variants. Both methods show that collaborative design, for example, via design modification in one domain (here spatial) to optimize the design in another domain (here structural) can be as effective as monodisciplinary optimization; however, it may need adjustments to avoid the designs becoming progressively unrealistic. Designers are informed of the merits and disadvantages of design process simulation and design instance exploration, whereas scientists learn from a first fully operational and automated method for design process simulation, which is verified with a genetic algorithm and subject to future improvements and extensions in the community.},

Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems is the book that initiated this field of study, presenting the theoretical foundations and exploring applications. In its most familiar form, adaptation is a biological process, whereby organisms evolve by rearranging genetic material to survive in environments confronting them. In this now classic work, Holland presents a mathematical model that allows for the nonlinearity of such complex interactions. He demonstrates the model's universality by applying it to economics, physiological psychology, game theory, and artificial intelligence and then outlines the way in which this approach modifies the traditional views of mathematical genetics. Initially applying his concepts to simply defined artificial systems with limited numbers of parameters, Holland goes on to explore their use in the study of a wide range of complex, naturally occuring processes, concentrating on systems having multiple factors that interact in nonlinear ways. Along the way he accounts for major effects of coadaptation and coevolution: the emergence of building blocks, or schemata, that are recombined and passed on to succeeding generations to provide, innovations and improvements.},

Two specific material constraints that {ADER} provides an interface for are limitations on the multiplication factor of a syste in Serpent 2 as well as limitations on the summed and weighted oxidation state of a material in Serpent 2. Taking all these considerations into account the optimization routines of {ADER} provide optimized material flows which are incorporated directly into the Serpent 2 burnup routines. {ADER} is expected to significantly advance the current state of molten salt reactor fuel evolution modelling and possibly other nuclear evolution modelling problems. {ADER} is available at github.com/ddwooten/{ADER}\_pub.},

	abstract = {A module based optimization method using genetic algorithms ({GA}), and multivariate regression analysis has been developed to optimize a set of parameters in the design of a nuclear reactor. {GA} simulates natural evolution to perform optimization, and is widely used in recent times by the scientiﬁc community. The {GA} ﬁts a population of random solutions to the optimized solution of a speciﬁc problem. In this work, we have developed a genetic algorithm to determine the values for a set of nuclear reactor parameters to design a gas cooled fast breeder reactor core including a basis thermal–hydraulics analysis, and energy transfer. Multivariate regression is implemented using regression splines ({RS}). Reactor designs are usually complex and a simulation needs a signiﬁcantly large amount of time to execute, hence the implementation of {GA} or any other global optimization techniques is not feasible, therefore we present a new method of using {RS} in conjunction with {GA}. Due to using {RS}, we do not necessarily need to run the neutronics simulation for all the inputs generated from the {GA} module rather, run the simulations for a predeﬁned set of inputs, build a multivariate regression ﬁt to the input and the output parameters, and then use this ﬁt to predict the output parameters for the inputs generated by {GA}. The reactor parameters are given by the, radius of a fuel pin cell, isotopic enrichment of the ﬁssile material in the fuel, mass ﬂow rate of the coolant, and temperature of the coolant at the core inlet. And, the optimization objectives for the reactor core are, high breeding of U-233 and Pu-239 in desired power peaking limits, desired effective and inﬁnite neutron multiplication factors, high fast ﬁssion factor, high thermal efﬁciency in the conversion from thermal energy to electrical energy using the Brayton cycle, and high fuel burn-up. It is to be noted that we have kept the total mass of the fuel as constant. In this work, we present a module based (modular) approach to perform the optimization wherein, we have deﬁned the following modules: single fuel pin cell, whole core, thermal–hydraulics, and energy conversion. In each of the modules we have deﬁned a speciﬁc set of parameters and optimization objectives. The {GA} system ({GAS}), and {RS} together, play the role of optimizing each of the individual modules, and integrating the modules to determine the ﬁnal nuclear reactor core. However, implementation of {GA} could lead to a local minimum or a non-unique set of parameters, those meet the speciﬁc optimization objectives. The {GA} code is built using Java, neutronic analysis using {MCNP}6, thermal–hydraulics calculations using Java, and regression analysis using R.},

	abstract = {Small Modular Reactors ({SMRs}) are the creative design of nuclear reactors that have received considerable attention in recent years. Since there is insufficient operational experience in {SMRs}, extensive research on these types of reactors may be needed to improve the current level of these systems performance. Also, one of the approaches which can help the enhancement of a reactor power is changing its fuel geometry. For this purpose, as well as decreasing the maximum fuel temperature in the reactors, the technology of annular fuels with the ability of internal and external cooling shows its importance. The nuclear {SMRs} with annular fuel which is cooled internally and externally has the potential to increase high power density while maintaining a sufficient safety margin. The benefit of the dual cooled annular fuel design is that heat can be transferred to the coolant at both the outer and inner channels. Hence, in this study, for the first time, dual cooled annular fuel in the Small Modular Reactors is considered and studied thoroughly. In this paper, neutronics and natural circulation parameters are calculated for an {SMR} with Annular Fuel which is cooled internally and externally, with changes of the internal radius. By analyzing the fuel internal radius changes in a specific range via the neutronics and computational fluid dynamics ({CFD}) simulation codes, the effects of power peaking factor, effective multiplication coefficient and natural circulation parameters are investigated. For the purpose of data fitting, an artificial neural network is trained using the observed data. The input consists of different internal radiuses which yields to output consisting effective multiplication factor, power peaking factor and natural circulation parameters. The Optimal geometry of annular fuel is determined using the neural network by implementing the genetic algorithms based on these neutronics and natural circulation parameters. Finally, using a simulated optimal geometry in the hot channel by neutronics and {CFD} simulations, thermal–hydraulic and neutronics calculations are accomplished, and these parameters are compared with the conventional {SMR} which uses solid (conventional) fuel. One of the main results of the evaluation is that optimal internally and externally cooled fuel in the presented {SMR} has a satisfactory margin for the departure from nucleate boiling ({DNB}) and maximum fuel rod temperature relative to the solid fuel which is used in the conventional {SMRs}. Indeed, fuel center temperature of conventional {SMR} is much more than that of presented optimal {SMR}. Also, presented optimal geometry increases the core effective multiplication coefficient which leads to increase in the excess reactivity. Also, reduces total power peaking factor and improves natural circulation parameters compared to the conventional {SMR}.},

Up to now, a number of dynamic studies have been performed to investigate the transient response of the system and its stability, but no control-oriented analyses have been carried out yet. This work focuses on a preliminary evaluation of the {MSFR} controllability issues, assuming a decentralized feedback scheme of control. For this purpose, a simplified model of the reactor primary circuit has been set up adopting a point-kinetics description and a one-dimensional description of neutronics and thermal–hydraulics, respectively. First, the effect of all the possible input variables on different sets of output variables is investigated by means of the Relative Gain Array ({RGA}) analysis, providing a brief overview of the best input/output pairings with no restrictions on the number of control variables that can be used. Some control schemes are then selected and implemented in the model of the primary circuit. The transient responses are analysed and compared, considering different control strategies. This work is thought to provide a first insight into some {MSFR} controllability issues as well as a preliminary evaluation of possible control options.},

The {FNS} would be customizable and interchangeable down to 1 × 1 × 10-in.-volume sections. An optimal core design requires the adjustment of many factors to both reduce the cost and accurately reproduce the spectra of interest during an experiment. A genetic algorithm was developed to optimize this complex design problem while reducing design time and expert judgment. The genetic algorithm was able to vary multiple design factors in an unattended fashion from a random initial population of designs and arrived at a design comparable to an expertly designed assembly.},

Nature provides examples of ramiﬁed, or branched, topologies that form non-intuitive solutions to various structural design problems. This work focuses on the development of a bioinspired topology optimization framework that couples genetic algorithms with a parallel rewriting system known as a Lindenmayer System (or L-System), which acts as an analogy to the evolutionary process and formalizes the encoding of a 2-D structure. Example design problems and the solutions determined using this novel framework are presented and compared to ideal solutions, where it is shown that a family of branched solutions allowed to evolve over generations can eventually arrive at effective multifunctional structures. Select designs from each example problem are also thickened into 3-D bodies, which are assessed experimentally via fully functional prototypes, demonstrating that the L-System framework is capable of generating realistic solutions for multifunctional structure development.},

	abstract = {The design of building integrated photovoltaics ({BIPV}) often involves complex geometries, non-uniform irradiance conditions and partial shading. This can lead to high energy losses if not considered adequately. This paper presents a {BIPV} modeling and optimization method which uses a parametric 3D modeling tool, coupled to a high-resolution ray-tracing irradiance simulation and an electrical model based on the single diode model on a subcell level. With the use of a genetic algorithm, electrical interconnections of the modules are optimized for maximum yield. The presented approach allows the simulation and optimization of {BIPV} in urban environments where complex shading occurs and high electrical mismatch of photovoltaic cells and modules is to be expected. It allows specific geometric design and optimization of photovoltaic installations and their electrical layout. The electrical simulation is validated for both flat and curved thin-film {CIGS} modules, as well as for two connected thin-film {CIGS} modules under deferring irradiance and partial shading conditions. The presented method is further applied in a case study on a double-curved roof shell. The results show that by using genetic algorithms the layout can be optimized to minimize the string mismatch losses for {BIPV} networks with a variety of modules. The detailed electrical simulation allows to quantify effects of module designs and inverter concepts on the system performance. This is demonstrated for the case study, indicating that thin-film modules with longitudinal cell direction outperform modules with orthogonal cell direction by up to 8\%. Furthermore, module-integrated bypass diodes show little benefits for the best performing module technologies. Post-processing the results allows the evaluation of annual, seasonal, daily and hourly losses on a highly disaggregated level.},

The higher temperatures offer the opportunity to significantly improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the energy conversion cycle. One of the concepts currently under study is the Molten Salt Reactor. The coolant from the Molten Salt Reactor may be available at temperatures as high as 800–1000 °C. At these temperatures, an open Brayton cycle combined with and Rankine bottoming cycle appears to have some strong advantages. Thermodynamic efficiencies approaching 50\% appear possible. Requirements for circulating cooling water will be significantly reduced. However, to realistically estimate the efficiencies achievable it is essential to have good models for the heat exchangers involved as well as the appropriate turbo-machinery. This study has concentrated on modeling all power conversion equipment from the fluid exiting the reactor to the energy releases to the environment.},

In addition, parametric modeling is encouraged in order to facilitate customization for other experiments. Parametric design using a solid modeling programming language allows customization and provides a source file for the design. {OpenSCAD} is the most widely used scripting tool for parametric modeling of open source labware. However, {OpenSCAD} lacks the ability to export to standard parametric formats; thus, the parametric dimensional information of the model is lost. This is an important deficiency because it is key to share the design in the most accessible formats with no information loss. In this work we analyze {OpenSCAD} and compare it with {FreeCAD} Python scripts. We have created a parametric open source hardware design to compare these tools. Our findings show that although Python for {FreeCAD} is more arduous to learn, its advantages counterbalance the initial difficulties. The main benefits are being able to export to standard parametric models; using Python language with its libraries; and the ability to use and integrate the models in its graphical interface. Thus, making it more appropriate to design open source hardware for scientific equipment.},

In this paper we propose a new procedure to detect patch of influential observations in the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity ({GARCH}) model. Firstly we compare the performance of innovative perturbation scheme, additive perturbation scheme and data perturbation scheme in local influence analysis. We find that the innovative perturbation scheme give better result than other two schemes although this perturbation scheme may suffer from masking effects. Then we use the stepwise local influence method under innovative perturbation scheme to detect patch of influential observations and uncover the masking effects. The simulated studies show that the new technique can successfully detect a patch of influential observations or outliers under innovative perturbation scheme. The analysis based on simulation studies and two real data sets show that the stepwise local influence method under innovative perturbation scheme is efficient for detecting multiple influential observations and dealing with masking effects in the {GARCH} model.},

This paper presents a marine soft robot inspired by the ghost knifefish that swims on the water surface by using an undulating fin underneath its body. We investigate how propagating wave functions can be evolved and how these affect the swimming performance of the robot. The fin and body of the robot are constructed from silicone and six wooden fin rays actuated by servo motors. In order to bypass the reality gap, which would necessitate a complex simulation of the fish, we implemented a Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy ({CMA}-{ES}) directly on the physical robot to optimize its controller for travel speed. Our results show that evolving a simple sine wave or a Fourier series can generate controllers that outperform a hand programmed controller. The results additionally demonstrate that the best evolved controllers share similarities with the undulation patterns of actual knifefish. Based on these results we suggest that evolution on physical robots is promising for future application in optimizing behaviors of soft robots.},

	abstract = {Organic thin-film transistors ({OTFTs}) can be fabricated at moderate temperatures and through cost-effective solution-based processes on a wide range of low-cost flexible and deformable substrates. Although the charge mobility of state-of-the-art {OTFTs} is superior to that of amorphous silicon and approaches that of amorphous oxide thin-film transistors ({TFTs}), their operational stability generally remains inferior and a point of concern for their commercial deployment. We report on an exhaustive characterization of {OTFTs} with an ultrathin bilayer gate dielectric comprising the amorphous fluoropolymer {CYTOP} and an Al2O3:{HfO}2 nanolaminate. Threshold voltage shifts measured at room temperature over time periods up to 5.9 × 105 s do not vary monotonically and remain below 0.2 V in microcrystalline {OTFTs} (μc-{OTFTs}) with field-effect carrier mobility values up to 1.6 cm2 V−1 s−1. Modeling of these shifts as a function of time with a double stretched-exponential ({DSE}) function suggests that two compensating aging mechanisms are at play and responsible for this high stability. The measured threshold voltage shifts at temperatures up to 75°C represent at least a one-order-of-magnitude improvement in the operational stability over previous reports, bringing {OTFT} technologies to a performance level comparable to that reported in the scientific literature for other commercial {TFTs} technologies.
Organic thin-film transistors exhibit an unprecedented level of reliability, bringing them closer to commercialization.

Due to its plank fuel design and inherently low heavy metal loading, which challenges fuel utilization, online refueling is considered as an option for improving the economic viability of this reactor. This work presents the thermal hydraulic modeling of the online refueling for the {AHTR}. Analyses at the single channel and fuel assembly level have been performed in order to develop a model of the reactor. The reactor modeling has been integrated with {CFD} studies for characterizing the steady state conditions and the refueling transient. The simulations of the transient have been complemented by the analysis of the stability of the refueling operation.},

It delivers heat to the industrial process or the power cycle at temperatures between 600°C and 700°C with average heat delivery temperatures higher than for other reactors. The melting point of the liquid salt coolant is above 450°C. The high minimum temperatures present refueling challenges and require special features to control temperatures, avoiding excessively high temperatures and freezing of the coolant that could impact decay heat cooling systems.

Due to their ability to accurately simulate complex geometries and utilize continuous-energy nuclear data, Monte Carlo methods are used in this study to evaluate core physics phenomena and provide reference solutions for veriﬁcation of lower ﬁdelity methods.

The {SERPENT} Monte Carlo code is selected and utilized to perform core physics analyses of an {FHR} fuel assembly. The issues investigated include detailed ﬁssion distribution, quantiﬁcation of certain approximations, study of neutron spectra in different material regions, and impact of graphite density, temperature, and scattering matrix data.

Liquid salt with high boiling point of over 1400 °C is used as a coolant and its baseline fuel is the graphite-matrix coated-particle fuel developed for hightemperature gas-cooled reactors. To establish advanced safety systems in {FHR}, passive decay heat removal system which utilizes ﬂuid’s natural circulation is considered. Three systems are proposed: Direct Reactor Air Cooling System ({DRACS}), Reactor Vessel Air Cooling System ({RVACS}), and Silo Cooling System ({SCS}). Although these three safety systems were previously developed for other types of reactors, their heat removal performances need to be evaluated for the {FHR} plant. The current study provides evaluation of decay heat removal systems of {FHR} during thermal-hydraulic transient. In addition, {FHR}’s grace period to start the reactor cooling was determined under the condition where no operable heat removal systems are available. The current study shows that {FHR}’s decay heat removal systems possess sufﬁcient heat removal capability to avoid catastrophic accidents. The construction of Fluoridesalt-cooled High-temperature Test Reactor ({FHTR}) is currently being planned and its development is a key step to realize the commercialization in near future. This study provides performance evaluation of decay heat systems for {FHTR} under thermal-hydraulic transient, and also suggests the adequate operation procedure suitable for {FHTR} to avoid a severe accident.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactor ({MSR}) has the characteristics of on-line reprocessing and continuously refueling, which bring significant differences from traditional reactors in burnup calculations. To handle its specific burnup characteristics, a Molten Salt Reactor specific depletion code - {MODEC} has been newly developed. {MODEC} implements two depletion algorithms to solve the basic burnup equations: the transmutation trajectory analysis ({TTA}) and the Chebyshev rational approximation method ({CRAM}). To simulate the on-line reprocessing, the fictive decay constant method is applied. And three different methods are implemented in {MODEC} to solve the nonhomogeneous burnup equations in the continuously refueling problems. Moreover, it can trace in real time the evolution of the in-stockpile nuclides which is extracted by on-line reprocessing. {MODEC} has three calculating modes for decay, constant flux and constant power calculations. By comparing with {ORIGEN}-S, the validity of performance of {MODEC} in conventional burnup calculations, burnup calculations with on-line reprocessing and burnup calculations with continuously refueling is proved. And a comparison of the three methods of solving nonhomogeneous burnup equations is presented and discussed. Additionally, a detailed analysis of error sources in {ORIGEN}-S is applied and an unpublished error source is found. Finally, a specific Monte Carlo burnup procedure for actual {MSR} burnup calculations is developed by coupling {KENO}-{VI} with {MODEC}, and the burnup benchmark of Molten Salt Fast Reactor ({MSFR}) is calculated to validate the specific Monte Carlo burnup procedure.},

It avoids problems related to degradation of raw materials. In this study, the Ga-In-Sn-Bi alloy-activated Al-H2O reaction was demonstrated to be rate-stable with a hydrogen productivity of 92\% and therefore superior to similar reactions activated by Ga-In and Ga-In-Sn alloys. To reveal the relevant activation mechanisms, the electrode potentials of three types of liquid metal alloys were tested. The effects of various liquid metal alloy compositions on hydrogen generation performance were determined via composition analysis and elemental characterization of the used reaction materials. The effects of several reaction conditions on hydrogen generation performance were evaluated. The reaction activation energy and by-product separation were also studied. It is feasible to provide a stable supply of hydrogen to a fuel cell and produce an output power of 0.73 W using a 3 g Al plate. Overall, the room-temperature Ga-In-Sn-Bi alloy-activated Al-H2O reaction can achieve real-time, on-demand hydrogen generation. This makes it a preferred choice to supply hydrogen to fuel cells.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a combination of a nuclear and a {CSP} plant and performs a thermodynamic analysis of the potential benefit. Most of today's operating nuclear reactor systems are producing saturated steam at relatively low pressure. This, in turn, limits their thermodynamic efficiency. Superheating of nuclear steam with solar thermal energy has the potential to overcome this drawback. Accordingly, an innovative configuration of a hybrid nuclear-{CSP} plant is assembled and simulated. It brings together pressurized water reactor and solar tower. The solar heat is transferred to nuclear steam to raise its temperature. Continuous superheating is provided through thermal energy storage. The results from design point calculations show that solar superheating has the potential to increase nuclear plant electric efficiency significantly, pushing it to around 37.5\%. Solar heat to electricity conversion efficiency reaches unprecedented rates of 56.2\%, approaching the effectiveness of the modern combined cycle gas turbine plants. Off-design model was used to simulate 24-h operation for one year by simulating 8760 cases. Due to implementation of thermal energy storage non-stop operation is manageable. The increased efficiency leads to solar tower island installed cost reductions of up to 25\% compared to the standalone {CSP} plant, particularly driven by the smaller solar field.},

	abstract = {Molten Salt Reactors represent one of promising future nuclear reactor concept included also in the Generation {IV} reactors family. This reactor type is distinguished by an extraordinarily close connection between the reactor physics and chemical technology, which is given by the specific features of the chemical form of fuel, representing by molten fluoride salt and circulating through the reactor core and also by the requirements of continuous ‘on-line’ reprocessing of the spent fuel. The history of Molten Salt Reactors reaches the period of fifties and sixties, when the first experimental Molten Salt Reactors were constructed and tested in {ORNL} ({US}). Several molten salt techniques dedicated to fresh molten salt fuel processing and spent fuel reprocessing were studied and developed in those days. Today, after nearly thirty years of discontinuance, a renewed interest in the Molten Salt Reactor technology is observed. Current experimental R\&D activities in the area of Molten Salt Reactor technology are realized by a relatively small number of research institutions mainly in the {EU}, Russia and {USA}. The main effort is directed primarily to the development of separation processes suitable for the molten salt fuel processing and reprocessing technology. The techniques under development are molten salt/liquid metal extraction processes, electrochemical separation processes from the molten salt media, fused salt volatilization techniques and gas extraction from the molten salt medium.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the continuous energy coarse mesh transport code {COMET} was used to provide the whole core transport solution to a set of stylized Advanced High Temperature Reactor ({AHTR}) benchmark problems. This set includes two full length single assembly and three full core conﬁgurations. Solving this type of reactor core is a signiﬁcant challenge to high and low order neutron transport methods because of its high heterogeneities due to {TRISO} fuel and burnable absorber particles imbedded in graphite plates with Y-shaped control blades and molten salt as coolant. The eigenvalue and ﬁssion density distributions calculated by {COMET} were compared with the direct Monte Carlo solutions. In the single assembly calculations, it was found that eight-bin expansion in energy and 2nd order expansion in the other phase space variables used by {COMET} are sufﬁcient for calculation of the eigenvalue and the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution, while 4th order expansion in space is necessary to obtain the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution with accuracy comparable to that of the continuous energy Monte Carlo method. It was also found that it is impractical to use Monte Carlo to generate the detailed solutions (stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution) to the full core benchmark problems because of the prohibitive computation resource requirement (estimated to be about 2200 days on an 84-{CPU} cluster). It took only about 4.5 h on a single {CPU} for {COMET} to calculate the detailed solution including the stripe-wise ﬁssion density distribution in the entire core. Given that {COMET} agreed very well with Monte Carlo in terms of assembly averaged and stripe-wise ﬁssion density distributions in the single assembly problems as well as in terms of the assembly averaged ﬁssion density distribution in the full core problems, it was concluded that the continuous energy {COMET} can provide the reference solution to the stylized {AHTR} benchmark problems.

	abstract = {The coarse mesh radiation transport method {COMET} developed for reactor physics calculations originally treated the phase space variable continuously except for the energy variable. In this work, the method is extended to also treat the energy variable continuously. {COMET} uses incident ﬂux response expansion coefﬁcients that are generated from local (oarse mesh) ﬁxed source calculations for obtaining the transport solution to whole core problems. In the new method, the energy dependence of the angular ﬂux (spectrum) is factorized into a product of two functions: a strongly varying asymptotic function and a slowly varying (smooth) shape function representing the deviation from the asymptotic function. The method uses spectra from a single assembly or color set calculation as the asymptotic functions and the shape function is expanded by the 0th order B-splines in a set of coarse energy bins. This new factorization allows the use of continuous energy stochastic method for generating the incident ﬂux response expansion coefﬁcients for solving whole-core problems. The new {COMET} method was tested in a {PWR} benchmark problem in whole core conﬁgurations using {UO}2 and {MOX} fuels. It was found that the {COMET} results agree very well with the corresponding continuous energy Monte Carlo reference solutions. The difference between the {COMET} and {MCNP} eigenvalues varied from 29 to 65 pcm, while the mean relative difference in the pin ﬁssion density distributions computed by {COMET} and {MCNP} was in the range of 0.25\%–0.63\% for three (namely, controlled, uncontrolled and some-rods-in) core conﬁgurations. This difference is less than 2 standard deviations of the {MCNP} uncertainty. The computational efﬁciency of the continuous energy {COMET} was found to be consistent with the multigroup {COMET} (i.e., more than 4 orders of magnitude faster than {MNCP}). Based on the benchmark results, it can be concluded that the new continuous energy expansion theory allows {COMET} to perform high ﬁdelity and highly efﬁcient whole-core transport calculations in heterogeneous reactors.},

This paper focuses on applications related to three key subareas related to safety and decision-making. These are reactor health and monitoring, radiation detection, and optimization. The principles of learning-based methods in these applications are explained and recent studies are explored. Furthermore, as these methods have become more practical during the past decade, it is foreseen that the popularity of learning-based methods in nuclear science and technology will increase; consequently, understanding the benefits and barriers of implementing such methodologies can help create better research plans, and identify project risks and opportunities.},

An operator support system, known as symptom-based diagnostic system ({SBDS}), has been developed using {ANN} that diagnoses the transients based on reactor process parameters, and continuously displays the status of the reactor. As a pilot study, the large break loss of coolant accident ({LOCA}) with and without the emergency core cooling system ({ECCS}) in reactor headers has been considered. Several break scenarios of large break {LOCA} have been analyzed. The time-dependent transient data have been generated using the {RELAP}5 thermal hydraulic code assuming an equilibrium core, which conforms to a realistic estimation. The diagnostic results obtained from the {ANN} study are satisfactory. These results have been incorporated in the {SBDS} software for operator assistance. A few important outputs of the {SBDS} have been discussed in this paper.},

The combination of {TRistructural}-{ISOtropic} ({TRISO}) coated-fuel particles, pebble bed core, and Flibe coolant leads to various neutronics challenges, such as the double heterogeneity, distribution of {TRISO} particles, high density packed pebble bed, neutronics characteristics of Flibe salt, and etc. For the purpose of evaluating candidate neutronics codes, benchmark study will be conducted for the inﬁnite fuel pebble lattice with explicitly described fuel particle distribution. For investigating key physics phenomena of the randomly packed pebble bed core, two coordinate generation methods will be explored in this study: Discrete Element Method ({DEM}) that accounts for inter-particle forces and a mathematical model ({MM}) that ﬁlls arbitrary domains through simple geometric rules on the addition of particles. While the former generates packing distributions closer to real-world scenarios, the latter is more computationally eﬀective. The pebble loading eﬀect on eigenvalues and ﬁssion power distribution will be studied. Emphasis is placed on the Flibe salt density reactivity eﬀect – the most unique feature of the {FHR} comparing to the conventional High Temperature Gascooled Reactors ({HTGRs}). Neutron balance based reactivity decomposition method will be employed for describing the underlying physics.},

	title = {Optimal Sizing of a Micro-Reactor for Embedded Grid Systems},
	abstract = {There has been significant work recently to develop en- ergy system concepts that incorporate a mixture of nuclear energy, variable renewable energy ({VRE}) and energy storage techniques. These systems are often referred to as nuclear hy- brid energy systems ({NHES}) and are generally robust, reliable, economically appealing, and have low to zero greenhouse gas ({GHG}) emissions [1, 2, 3, 4]. In 2015, the University of Illi- nois at Urbana-Champaign ({UIUC}) made a commitment to reach carbon neutrality by 2050 in the Illinois Climate Ac- tion Plan ({iCAP}) [5]. This plan identified nuclear energy as a potential contributor to this goal. In this work we use the {RAVEN} framework to find the optimal size for a micro-reactor that would minimize the levelized cost of electricity ({LCOE}) for the {UIUC} embedded grid. The greatest source economic variability is contained in the capital costs of a micro-reactor. Thus we examine both scenarios where the reactor is provided at no cost to the university and purchased at full price.},

These layouts can be used via a C library interface, streambased command line tools, graphical user interfaces and web browsers. Aspects which distinguish the software include a retention of stream-based interfaces in conjunction with a variety of tools for graph manipulation, and support for a wide assortment of graphical features and output formats. The former makes it possible to write high-level programs for querying, modifying and displaying graphs. The latter allows Graphviz to be useful in a wide range of areas, with applications far removed from academic exercises. The algorithms of Graphviz concentrate on static layouts. Dynagraph is a sibling of Graphviz, with algorithms and interactive programs for incremental layout. At the library level, it provides an object-oriented interface for graphs and graph algorithms.},

The integration of the {TPV} is attractive for increased efficiency over the heat cycles of traditional nuclear power plants ({NPP}) and increased inherent safety from the elimination of a working fluid. Allowing for heat removal through radiative and passive convective cooling, the design must operate at low power densities. A preliminary sampling of the design space was performed using coupled thermal and neutronic analysis on a simplified model. This study shows the viability of the design and reveals the favorability of using uranium nitride fuel that allow the core to operate safely at approximately 1–2 W/cm3 within the desired temperature limits. Although preliminary, the depletion and economic analyses reveal an operational time on the order of ten thousand days and approximately 43\% savings in {NPP} capital costs.},

In addition to the safety assessment of nuclear power plant, decay heat estimates are needed for the evaluation of shielding requirements on fuel discharge and transport routes and for the safe management of radioactive waste products extracted from spent fuel during reprocessing. The decay heat estimates may be derived by either summation calculations or Standard equations. This paper reviews the development of these evaluation methods and traces their evolution since the first studies of the 1940s. In contrast to many of the previous reviews of this subject, both actinide and fission product evaluation methods are reviewed in parallel. Data requirements for summation calculations are examined and a summary given of available codes and their data libraries. The capabilities of present-day summation methods are illustrated through comparisons with available experimental results. Uncertainties in summation results are examined in terms of those in the basic nuclear data, irradiation details and method of calculation. The evolution of decay heat Standards is described and a brief examination made of their reliability and ability to provide suitably conservative decay heat estimates. Finally, to illustrate the use of present summation methods, comparisons are given of both the actinide and fission product decay heat levels from typical fuel samples in a variety of reactor systems.},

It also must be known in order to design spent fuel storage systems, shutdown reactor cooling systems and heat sink, reprocessing and nuclear waste disposal systems. Of these applications, the analysis of reactor accident scenarios has been the main impetus to develop more accurate methods of decay heat evaluation. It was recognized early in the 1970s that the knowledge was inadequate for safety requirements and that this placed an economic burden on nuclear power plants. Intensive research has been undertaken in the past few years and this has led to a much more precise knowledge of decay heat power in Light Water Reactors ({LWR}). With additional work this improvement can soon be extended to other reactors types. This paper reviews the background, recent research developments and the evolution of a major revision of the American Nuclear Society Standard for decay heat power in {LWR}.},

As a case-study, we provide preliminary results and demonstrate feasibility of our approach by processing the {EHR} of a diabetic cohort in Singapore. Our model passes the feasibility test as we are able to forecast a series of health complications of a new patient based on the factor functions inferred from {EHR} of 100 diabetic patients spanning 10-years. This forecast gives both the caregivers and the patient a better view of the patient's health in the coming years and increases patient's motivation to stay healthy and conform to medication plan. Furthermore, our approach informs commonly occurring health complications in the population that warrant hospital readmissions, which helps a physician/clinician in decide when to intervene to avoid complications in order to improve the patient's quality of life and minimize the cost of care.},

	abstract = {Transition from analog to digital instrumentation and control systems requires a systematic study of the modifications, and assessment of their reliability. Such studies are often carried out on a test bed. The test bed developed earlier includes a commercially available triple modular redundant ({TMR}) programmable logic controller ({PLC}) for testing not only the reliability of the digital I\&C but also the cyber-security of the system during plant operation. This paper reports results of our preliminary analyses carried out using the test bed following the injection of faults mimicking faulty sensors. The fault injection tool generates faulty signals in single or multiple sensors located in the primary loop. These scenarios studied under steady-state operation conditions simulate a bad sensor, a cut wire, noise, etc. The faults injected can lead to information being displayed in the main control room ({MCR}) to not match the conditions in the plant. In addition to a fault injection module, a result analyzer module is also a part of this testbed. Operator actions can be based on information displayed in the {MCR}, or they can be informed by the result analyzer. Potential operator actions following these single- or multiple faulty signals are assessed. It is concluded that the result analyzer in some cases can be helpful in guiding operators to make the right decisions. Copyright © (2017) by American Nuclear Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The production of hydrogen from water using solar energy via a two-step thermochemical cycle is considered. The first, endothermic step is the thermal dissociation of {ZnO}(s) into Zn(g) and O2 at 2300K using concentrated solar energy as the source of process heat. The second, non-solar, exothermic step is the hydrolysis of Zn(l) at 700K to form H2 and {ZnO}(s); the latter separates naturally and is recycled to the first step. Hydrogen and oxygen are derived in different steps, thereby eliminating the need for high-temperature gas separation. A 2nd-law analysis performed on the closed cyclic process indicates a maximum exergy conversion efficiency of 29\% (ratio of ΔG298K°{\textbar}H2+0.5O2→H2O for the H2 produced to the solar power input), when using a solar cavity-receiver operated at 2300K and subjected to a solar flux concentration ratio of 5000. The major sources of irreversibility are associated with the re-radiation losses from the solar reactor and the quenching of Zn(g) and O2 to avoid their recombination. An economic assessment for a large-scale chemical plant, having a solar thermal power input into the solar reactor of 90MW and a hydrogen production output from the hydrolyser of 61 million-{kWh}/yr, indicates that the cost of solar hydrogen ranges between 0.13 and 0.15\$/{kWh} (based on its low heating value and a heliostat field cost at 100–150\$/m2) and, thus, might be competitive vis-à-vis other renewables-based routes such as electrolysis of water using solar-generated electricity. The economic feasibility of the proposed solar process is strongly dependent on the development of an effective Zn/O2 separation technique (either by quench or by in situ electrolytic separation) that eliminates the need for an inert gas. The chemical aspects of the reactions involved and the present status of the pertinent chemical reactor technology are summarized.},

	abstract = {In this study, we present a comparative environmental impact assessment of possible hydrogen production methods from renewable and non-renewable sources with a special emphasis on their application in Turkey. It is aimed to study and compare the performances of hydrogen production methods and assess their economic, social and environmental impacts, The methods considered in this study are natural gas steam reforming, coal gasification, water electrolysis via wind and solar energies, biomass gasification, thermochemical water splitting with a Cu–Cl and S–I cycles, and high temperature electrolysis. Environmental impacts (global warming potential, {GWP} and acidification potential, {AP}), production costs, energy and exergy efficiencies of these eight methods are compared. Furthermore, the relationship between plant capacity and hydrogen production capital cost is studied. The social cost of carbon concept is used to present the relations between environmental impacts and economic factors. The results indicate that thermochemical water splitting with the Cu–Cl and S–I cycles become more environmentally benign than the other traditional methods in terms of emissions. The options with wind, solar and high temperature electrolysis also provide environmentally attractive results. Electrolysis methods are found to be least attractive when production costs are considered. Therefore, increasing the efficiencies and hence decreasing the costs of hydrogen production from solar and wind electrolysis bring them forefront as potential options. The energy and exergy efficiency comparison study indicates the advantages of biomass gasification over other methods. Overall rankings show that thermochemical Cu–Cl and S–I cycles are primarily promising candidates to produce hydrogen in an environmentally benign and cost-effective way.},

	abstract = {The present work considers the impact of hydrogen fuel on the environment within the cycles of its generation and combustion. Hydrogen has been portrayed by the media as a fuel that is environmentally clean because its combustion results in the formation of harmless water. However, hydrogen first must be generated. The effect of hydrogen generation on the environment depends on the production process and the related by-products. Hydrogen available on the market at present is mainly generated by using steam reforming of natural gas, which is a fossil fuel. Its by-product is {CO}2, which is a greenhouse gas and its emission results in global warming and climate change. Therefore, hydrogen generated from fossil fuels is contributing to global warming to the similar extent as direct combustion of the fossil fuels. On the other hand hydrogen obtained from renewable energy, such solar energy, is environmentally clean during the cycles of its generation and combustion. Consequently, the introduction of hydrogen economy must be accompanied by the development of hydrogen that is environmentally friendly. The present work considers several aspects related to the generation and utilisation of hydrogen obtained by steam reforming and solar energy conversion (solar-hydrogen).},

	abstract = {A technoeconomic analysis of photoelectrochemical ({PEC}) and photovoltaic-electrolytic ({PV}-E) solar-hydrogen production of 10 000 kg H2 day−1 (3.65 kilotons per year) was performed to assess the economics of each technology, and to provide a basis for comparison between these technologies as well as within the broader energy landscape. Two {PEC} systems, differentiated primarily by the extent of solar concentration (unconcentrated and 10× concentrated) and two {PV}-E systems, differentiated by the degree of grid connectivity (unconnected and grid supplemented), were analyzed. In each case, a base-case system that used established designs and materials was compared to prospective systems that might be envisioned and developed in the future with the goal of achieving substantially lower overall system costs. With identical overall plant efficiencies of 9.8\%, the unconcentrated {PEC} and non-grid connected {PV}-E system base-case capital expenses for the rated capacity of 3.65 kilotons H2 per year were \$205 {MM} (\$293 per m2 of solar collection area ({mS}−2), \$14.7 {WH}2,P−1) and \$260 {MM} (\$371 {mS}−2, \$18.8 {WH}2,P−1), respectively. The untaxed, plant-gate levelized costs for the hydrogen product ({LCH}) were \$11.4 kg−1 and \$12.1 kg−1 for the base-case {PEC} and {PV}-E systems, respectively. The 10× concentrated {PEC} base-case system capital cost was \$160 {MM} (\$428 {mS}−2, \$11.5 {WH}2,P−1) and for an efficiency of 20\% the {LCH} was \$9.2 kg−1. Likewise, the grid supplemented base-case {PV}-E system capital cost was \$66 {MM} (\$441 {mS}−2, \$11.5 {WH}2,P−1), and with solar-to-hydrogen and grid electrolysis system efficiencies of 9.8\% and 61\%, respectively, the {LCH} was \$6.1 kg−1. As a benchmark, a proton-exchange membrane ({PEM}) based grid-connected electrolysis system was analyzed. Assuming a system efficiency of 61\% and a grid electricity cost of \$0.07 {kWh}−1, the {LCH} was \$5.5 kg−1. A sensitivity analysis indicated that, relative to the base-case, increases in the system efficiency could effect the greatest cost reductions for all systems, due to the areal dependencies of many of the components. The balance-of-systems ({BoS}) costs were the largest factor in differentiating the {PEC} and {PV}-E systems. No single or combination of technical advancements based on currently demonstrated technology can provide sufficient cost reductions to allow solar hydrogen to directly compete on a levelized cost basis with hydrogen produced from fossil energy. Specifically, a cost of {CO}2 greater than ∼\$800 (ton {CO}2)−1 was estimated to be necessary for base-case {PEC} hydrogen to reach price parity with hydrogen derived from steam reforming of methane priced at \$12 {GJ}−1 (\$1.39 (kg H2)−1). A comparison with low {CO}2 and {CO}2-neutral energy sources indicated that base-case {PEC} hydrogen is not currently cost-competitive with electrolysis using electricity supplied by nuclear power or from fossil-fuels in conjunction with carbon capture and storage. Solar electricity production and storage using either batteries or {PEC} hydrogen technologies are currently an order of magnitude greater in cost than electricity prices with no clear advantage to either battery or hydrogen storage as of yet. Significant advances in {PEC} technology performance and system cost reductions are necessary to enable cost-effective {PEC}-derived solar hydrogen for use in scalable grid-storage applications as well as for use as a chemical feedstock precursor to {CO}2-neutral high energy-density transportation fuels. Hence such applications are an opportunity for foundational research to contribute to the development of disruptive approaches to solar fuels generation systems that can offer higher performance at much lower cost than is provided by current embodiments of solar fuels generators. Efforts to directly reduce {CO}2 photoelectrochemically or electrochemically could potentially produce products with higher value than hydrogen, but many, as yet unmet, challenges include catalytic efficiency and selectivity, and {CO}2 mass transport rates and feedstock cost. Major breakthroughs are required to obtain viable economic costs for solar hydrogen production, but the barriers to achieve cost-competitiveness with existing large-scale thermochemical processes for {CO}2 reduction are even greater.},
