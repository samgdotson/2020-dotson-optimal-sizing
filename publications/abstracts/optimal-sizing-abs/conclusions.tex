\section{Conclusions}

Baker et. al found that increasing penetration of renewables increased grid volatility which exponentially increased the LCOE of the energy system when subject to a mismatch penalty. They also found that energy storage becomes increasingly valuable for grid stability at or above 20\% renewable penetration. The UIUC campus does not yet have enough renewable capacity to meet this criterion. It is also critical to note that in this work we largely ignored the steam demand for the UIUC campus despite its significance to the overall energy system. Future work will consider the role of a micro-reactor on campus where it is enabled for co-generation and can replace natural gas capacity at APP. Here we have shown that the methodology outlined in \cite{baker_optimal_2018} can be extended to another energy system.
