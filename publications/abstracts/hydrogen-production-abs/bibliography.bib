	abstract = {A detailed economics model of hydrogen infrastructure in California has been developed and applied to assess several potential fuel cell vehicle deployment rate and hydrogen station technology scenarios. The model accounts for all of the costs in the hydrogen supply chain and speciﬁcally examines a network of 68 planned and existing hydrogen stations in terms of economic viability and dispensed hydrogen cost. Results show that (1) current high-pressure gaseous delivery and liquid delivery station technologies can eventually be proﬁtable with relatively low vehicle deployment rates, and (2) the cost per mile for operating fuel cell vehicles can be lower than equivalent gasoline vehicles in both the near and long term.},

	abstract = {Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) has been conducting a study on a thermochemical IS process for hydrogen production. A pilot test of IS process is under planning that covers four R\&D subjects: (1) construction of a pilot test plant made of industrial materials and completion of a hydrogen production test using electrically-heated helium gas as the process heat supplier, (2) development of an analytical code system, (3) component tests to assist the hydrogen production test and also to improve the process performance for the commercial plant, (4) a design study of HTTR-IS system. Development of innovative chemical reactors is in progress, which are equipped with a ceramic heat exchanger. In the design of the IS plant, it is important to establish the system for ‘‘design by analysis’’. Therefore, we have developed a multiphase ﬂow analysis code that can analyze systems in which chemical reactions occur.},
