\frametitle{Conclusions}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The University of Illinois is actively working to reduce GHG emissions on its campus. 
	\item A few microreactor designs would be able to produce enough hydrogen to meet MTD and UIUC fleet fuel demand.
	\item Increased solar penetration worsens the duck curve.
	\item Hydrogen introduces a way to store energy that reduces the reliance on dispatchable sources.
	\item Nuclear energy and hydrogen production present an approach to mitigate the negative implications of the duck curve.

\end{itemize}
