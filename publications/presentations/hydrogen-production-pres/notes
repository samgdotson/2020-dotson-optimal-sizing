Introduction:
-------------
American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment.
More than 300 institutions accross the US.

Transportation:
---------------

Only product is water vapor.

Japan:
Under the Paris Agreement: goal for the country to be carbon-neutral soon after 2050.
Japans depends on overseas fossil fuels for about a 94% of its priamry energy supply.
Fuel cell vehicles, trucks, buses, forklifts, trains, and ships.

Germany:
Hydrogen-powered train.

California:
Currently, 39 hydrogen refueling stations. Expects 200 for 2025, and 1000 for 2030.
This would provide the capacity and coverage needed for drivers to travel anywhere throughout California.

Champaign-Urbana:
2 hydrogen buses expected to start working this year.


A possible solution:
--------------------

DOE and INL established the NGNP Project.
The mission of the NGNP Project is to develop, license, build, and operate a prototype modular high temperature gas-cooled reactor (HTGR) plant that would generate high-temperature process heat for use in hydrogen production.

H2@Scale is a DOE initiative that explores the potential for wide-scale hydrogen production and utilization in the US.

Microreactors:
--------------
- Factory fabricated: large-scale construction, reduces capital costs
- Transportable: Easier to transport. By ship, truck, railcar.
- Self regulating: reduce the number of specialized operators by utilizing passive safety systems.


Results:
--------

Energy generation:
------------------
- US growth: 0.8%
- Solar growth: 511%
