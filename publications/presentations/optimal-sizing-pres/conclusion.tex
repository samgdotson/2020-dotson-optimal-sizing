  \frametitle{Conclusion}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Replacing ``ABBOTT'' with nuclear would resolve all of the Universities
    carbon goals, \textit{regardless of other offsets and building growth.}
    \item Adding, even limited, nuclear capacity will cost effectively meet carbon goals until mid-decade when renewable resources must be expanded.
    \item This model is agnostic to implementation:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One 100 MWth small modular reactor
      \item Series of 20 MWth micro-reactors
    \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
